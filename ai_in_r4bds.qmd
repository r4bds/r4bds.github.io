# Use of AI in the R for Bio Data Science Course {.unnumbered #sec-air4bds}

Please note, that rules on the use of Generative AI (GAI) in "written exams with all aids - without internet." are such that in addition to written aids, students are allowed to bring laptops, tablets, and similar devices but it is NOT allowed to use generative AI, even if the tool is available in an offline version!

Failure to comply with the above, will be considered cheating and reported as such.

_The following is a copy of [Study announcement s1906](https://student.dtu.dk/en/messages/studiemeddelelser/studiemeddelelse-s1906-retningslinjer-for-brug-af-generativ-ai-i-projektrapporter-og-afsluttende-projekter?id=98eeba12-9c99-478a-aced-b0e36071efa2). It is **very** important that students are familiar with the official rules concerning use of AI and also that it remains the responsibility of the student to be in full compliance with the following_

## Guidelines on the use of generative AI in project reports and final project assignments

DTU has developed guidelines for the use of generative AI in project reports and final projects, which you must follow if you choose to use generative AI. DTU permits the use of generative AI, but you are required to describe your use and provide proper source referencing. Failure to do so will be considered exam cheating in accordance with [DTU’s code of honour](https://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/eksamenssnyd/dtu-code-of-honour) and the [rules on cheating at exams and other forms of assessments](https://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/cheating-at-exams-and-other-forms-of-assessment).

You must remember to:

- You must clearly state that you have used generative AI in your report and describe how you have used it.
- Take full responsibility for your report and ensure that all decisions regarding its content are your own.
- Document your use of generative AI.
- Always provide source references when using text generated by AI.
- Be aware that your lecturer/supervisor may require that prompts and/or AI-generated output be included as appendices in your report.

You can [find DTU’s guidelines on the use of generative AI in project reports and final project assignments](https://www.bibliotek.dtu.dk/en/publishing/reference-management/kunstig-intelligens/eksempler) at DTU Library. DTU Library also has a guide on how to [reference when using generative AI](https://www.bibliotek.dtu.dk/en/publishing/reference-management/kunstig-intelligens).

### Questions?
If you have academic questions about the use of generative AI in a specific course or project, you can contact your lecturer or supervisor. If you have general questions about the guidelines, exam rules, cheating, or plagiarism, you can contact the [Study Guidance](https://student.dtu.dk/en/vejledning/studievejledningen).
