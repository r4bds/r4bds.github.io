## Learning Materials

_Please prepare the following materials_

- Book: [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) -- Read chapters 1 (intro), 20 (basic terms), 22 (branching), 23 (remotes). Do not pay much attention to syntax of specific commands, because we are not going to use them during the exercises, focus on the idea
- Book: [Introduction to Data Science - Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R by Rafael A. Irizarry: Chapter 40 Git and GitHub](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/git.html) -- Some of the information here is redundant with the previous book, but very important thing is a visualization of basic git actions and screenshots of how to perform them using RStudio
- Video: [RStudio and Git - an Overview (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLycV1IWqc) -- Basic git concepts, for those who prefer listen rather than read. Books, however, contain more information
- Video: [How to use Git and GitHub with R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL6L2MNqPHg) -- Basic operating on git in RStudio. Complementary to second book. You can skip to 2:50, we are not going to link to git manually either way

_Unless explicitly stated, do not do the per-chapter exercises in the R4DS2e book_

## Learning Objectives

_A student who has met the objectives of the session will be able to:_

- Explain why reproducible data analysis is important
- Identify associated relevant challenges
- Describe the components of a reproducible data analysis
- Use RStudio and GitHub (git) for collaborative bio data science projects

## Exercises {#sec-exercises}

### Prologue

Using `git` is completely central for collaborative bio data science. You can use `git` not only for `R`, but for any code-based 
project in any language or code editor. From small research groups to tech giants, almost every bioinformatics, data science or 
software engineering project in the world uses `git` to manage code versions and collaboration.

Learning`git` is a key Bio  Data Science skill that will be expected of you for almost any bioinformatics job! Today, you will 
take your first steps - Happy Learning!

![](images/git_collab.gif){fig-align="center" width=80%}

- **T1:** Find the `GitHub` repository for the `ggplot2` R-package
- **Q1:** How many Contributors are there?
- **T1:** Find the `GitHub` repository for the `Linux kernel`
- **Q2:** How many Contributors are there?
- **Q3:** Discuss in your group why having an organised approach to version control is central? And consider the simple contrast of the challenges you were facing when doing the course assignments.

### Getting Started

_First, make sure to read and discuss the feedback you got from last week's assignment!_

<span style="color: red;">**The following exercises have to be done in your groups! You must move at the same pace and progress together as a team through the exercises!**</span> 

<span style="color: red;">**Be aware of which editor you are using in RStudio! You must work in the "Visual" editor instead of the "Source" editor. ALL OF YOU! If one of you works in a different editor, it could cause a conflict issue!**</span>

*GitHub is **the** place for collaborative coding and different group members will have to do different tasks in a specific order, to make it through the exercises together, so... Team Up and don't rush it!*

First, select a team **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Captain</span>**, that person will have to carry out specific tasks. If **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Team</span>** is stated, then that refers to all group members and lastly if **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Crew</span>** is stated, then that is everyone but the **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Captain</span>**. Please note, that tasks are sequential, so if a task is assigned to the **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Captain</span>**, then the **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Crew</span>** has to await completion before proceeding!

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Team</span>**

#### Setting up your Credentials and Personal Access Token 

*Before you do anything relating to GitHub repositories, you have to inform GitHub of who you are and let GitHub verify what your account is.*

1. In the `Console`, run the command:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME", user.email = "THE_EMAIL_YOU_USED_TO_CREATE_YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT")
```

2. In the `Console`, run the command:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
usethis::create_github_token()
```

3. Log into GitHub if not logged in already
4. Under *Note*, where it says *DESCRIBE THE TOKEN'S USE CASE*, delete the text and write e.g.`R for Bio Data Science lab 7 git exercises`
5. Under *Expiration*, where it says *30 days*, change that to *90 days*
6. Do not change any other setting, but simply scroll down and click *Generate token*
7. A new *Personal access tokens (classic)* page will appear, stating your personal access token, which starts with `ghp_`, go ahead and copy it
8. Store the PAT somewhere safe, e.g. in a password management tool. It is effectively your password when connecting to the repository via R.
9. Again in the Console, run the below command and enter your PAT when prompted for the password:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

Before proceeding, make sure that **ALL** group members are at this stage of the exercises.

#### Making your Credentials and Personal Access Token stick around

*By default, your credentials and PAT are cleaned every 15 minutes. This is annoying, so let's fix it!*

First of all RStudio is a Graphical User Interface (GUI), meaning, that it allows you to do pointy-clicky stuff, but at the end of the day, everything happens at the command line. That also goes for git, so your button-pushing simply gets converted into commands, which are executed in the terminal.

If you are not comfortable with the terminal, don't worry! We will only do a short visit to the command line to do a few things that are not available in the GUI and then return to the pointy-clicky stuff:

1. In the `Console` pane, click the `Terminal` tab, which gains you access to the Linux server that RStudio is running on
2. You should see something like:

```bash
user@pupilX:~/projects/lab07_git_exercises$
```
3. Enter the command:
```bash
git config --global --list
```
4. Recall you entered your GitHub username and mail? This is where it ended up! Note the `credential.helper=cache`, which tells us, that the credentials are being cached. Now, enter:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=86400'
```
5. Re-run the command `git config --global --list` and confirm the change
6. Go back to your `Console` and run the command `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`. Select option 2, and re-enter your PAT.
7. If you didn't get a list of options in the prior step, restart your R session and retry.

*Congratulations! You have now used the command line and you will forever be part of an elite few, who know that everything you see in hacker-movies is BS, except perhaps for Wargames and Mr. Robot! Also, your PAT will now be good for 24h* 

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Team</span>**

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in
1. In the upper right corner, click on your profile picture. Then in the menu, click on "Your Organizations" and go into rforbiodatascienceYY (where `YY` is the current year). **If you are not a member, contact a TA before proceeding.** Next, go into repositories (top left).

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Captain</span>**

#### **Creating the repository**

1. Click "New repository"
1. Since you created the project from the organisation, the default owner of the repository is the organisation (rforbiodatascienceYY). Verify and keep that, please.
1. Name the repository `groupXX`, where `XX` is your group number, e.g. `02`
1. Select `Public`
1. Tick `Add a README file`
1. Click `Create repository`
1. Click `Settings` in the menu line starting with `<> Code`
1. Under `Access`, click `Collaborators and teams`
1. Click `Add people`
1. Write a group members username and select the role "Maintain".
1. Select `Add username to this repository`
1. Repeat for all group members

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Crew</span>**

1. Refresh the page and go into the new repository. If you don't see it, check your mail and accept your invitation to join the repository.

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Captain</span>**

#### **Cloning the repository**

1. [Click here](https://teaching.healthtech.dtu.dk/22100/rstudio.php) to go to the course RStudio cloud server and login
1. In the upper right corner, click on ![](images/paths_new_proj.png)`<your_current_project_name>`
1. Choose ![](images/paths_new_proj_plus.png) `New Project...`
1. Select ![](images/icon_version_control.png) **Version Control**
1. Select ![](images/icon_git.png) **Git**
1. Under `Repository URL:`, enter `https://github.com/rforbiodatascienceYY/groupXX`, where again you replace `YY` with  the current year and replace `XX` with your group number, e.g. `02`. 
1. Under `Project directory name:`, enter `lab07_git_exercises`
1. Under `Create project as a subdirectory of:`, make sure that is says `~/projects`
1. Click `Create Project`

*Congratulations! You have just cloned your first GitHub repository!*

In your `Files` pane, you should now see:

![](images/git_first_files.png){fig-align="center" width=40%}

...and now in your `Environment` pane, you should see a new `Git` tab:

![](images/git_environment_pane.png){fig-align="center" width=50%}

If you click the `Git` tab, you should see:

![](images/environment_pane_git_tab.png){fig-align="center" width=50%}

#### **Pushing the project basics to GitHub**

1. In the `Git` tab, tick the 2 boxes under `staged` (we will get into what `.gitignore` is later)
1. Click `commit`
1. In the upper right corner, add a `Commit message`, e.g "Project basics"
1. Click the `Commit` button
1. A pop-up, will give you details on your commit, look through them and then click `Close`
1. Click the ![](images/pull.png) `Pull` button, then the ![](images/push.png) `Push` button

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Crew</span>**

1. Make sure that you can see the `lab07_git_exercises.Rproj` and `.gitignore` files that your captain just pushed in the GitHub repository before proceeding further
1. Follow the instructions under *Cloning the repository* that your captain followed a few moments ago (but **not** the *Pushing the project basics to GitHub*)

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Team</span>**

#### Setting up `git`'s pull strategy

In the `Console`, run the command:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
usethis::use_git_config(pull.rebase = "false")
```

<details>
<p><summary>For now, you can ignore what `pull.rebase` does, but click here if you are curious</summary></p>
When pulling from a repository that has received new commits between your last `pull` and your last commit, you can run into the problem that 
there are new commits with changes in the same places of the code as you have been editing. In this case, a rebase will simply apply your changes 
on top of whatever modifications happened in those new commits. This can sometimes break the code and it can be hard to understand why. Setting 
`pull.rebase = "false"` will make it so that you are forced to solve the conflicting changes manually when you run into that situation. You can 
find a much more technical explanation on merging vs. rebasing [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing).

If you do not set `pull.rebase` at all, the first time that your `pull` conflicts with existing commits git will simply ask you to set it. Doing 
it now simply avoids the error message from appearing later.
</details>

### Your first collaboration

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Team</span>**

1. Create a new Quarto document, title it `student_id` and save id as `student_id.qmd`, where `student_id` is your... You guessed it! **Make sure that "Use visual markdown editor" is checked.**
1. In the `environment` pane, click the `git` tab
1. Tick the 3 boxes under `staged`
1. Click `commit`
1. In the upper right corner, add a `Commit message`, e.g "First commit by student_id"
1. Click the `Commit` button
1. A pop-up, will give you details on your commit, look through them and then click `Close`
1. Now, very important **ALWAYS** click the ![](images/pull.png) `Pull` button **BEFORE** clicking the ![](images/push.png) `Push` button
1. Clicking `Pull`, you should see "Already up to date."
1. Then click `Push`

- **Q4:** Discuss in your group what each of the steps did and why they are performed? 


### Your next collaboration

*That first collaboration was easy right!? Well, you were all working on different files...*

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Captain</span>**

1. Create a new Quarto Document, title it "Group Document" and save it as `group_document.qmd`
1. Using markdown headers, create one section for each group member, incl. yourself. Here, you can use your names, student ids or whatever you deem appropriate
1. Again in the `Environment` pane, make sure you are in the `git` tab and then tick the box next to `group_document.qmd`. If you do not see the document in this window after saving, click the ![](images/git_refresh_button.png) refresh button on the top right of the `Git` tab.
1. Click `Commit`
1. Add a commit message, e.g. "Add group document"
1. Click the `Commit` button
1. Click `Pull` (You should be "Already up to date.")
1. Click `Push`
1. Click `Close`
1. Again, go to the group GitHub and confirm that you see the new document you just created

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Team</span>**

1. Click `Pull` and confirm that you now also have the file `group_document.qmd`
1. Open `group_document.qmd` and find your assigned section
1. In your section and your section only, enter some text, add a few code chunks with some R code
1. Save the document
1. Now again, find the `group_document.qmd` in the `git` tab of the `Environment` pane and tick the box under `Staged`
1. Click `Commit`
1. Note how your changes to the document are highlighted in green
1. Add a commit message, e.g. "Update the STUDENT_ID section" and click `Commit` and then `Close`
1. As we shoudl always do after committing: ![](images/pull.png) `Pull`, then ![](images/push.png) `Push`
1. Go to the group GitHub, find the `group_document.qmd` and click it, do you see your changes?

Once **everyone** has added to their assigned section, **everyone** should do a pull/push, so **everyone** has the complete version of the `group_document.qmd`. If everything was done correctly there should be no merge conflicts, but contact a TA if anything went wrong.

### Your first branching

Ok that's pretty great so far - Right? The thing is... Consider, the `ggplot2` repository, that you found in *T1*. Thousands of companies and even more thousands of people rely on `ggplot` for advanced data visualisation. What would happen, if you wanted to add a new feature or wanted to optimise an existing one, while people were actively installing your package? They would get what stage your code was in, which may or may not be functional - Enter branching!

Below here is an illustrated example where each circle is a `git` commit. The **<span style="color:green;">main</span>** branch is the stable version of the software that people can download. **<span style="color:blue;">Your Work</span>** will be the feature or update that you personally are working on and **<span style="color:orange;">Someone Else's Work</span>** will be another team working on a different new feature or update. Before the last commit in **<span style="color:green;">main</span>** (the right-most green circle), note how both the **<span style="color:blue;">Your Work</span>** and **<span style="color:orange;">Someone Else's Work</span>**-branches have been merged onto the **<span style="color:green;">main</span>**-branch.

![](images/git_branching_merging.png){fig-align="center" width=90%}

*Note: until not so long ago, the default name for the main branch used to be "master". For obvious reasons, the software engineering world is moving away from the master/slave terminology...*

In a `git` repository, there can be as many branches as you want. Software teams usually have guidelines on how to organize branches on a specific repository and it can vary substantially between teams and/or projects.

- **Q5:** Find the `ggplot` GitHub repo again. How many branches there are?

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Team</span>**

1. Go to your RStudio session and in the `git` tab of the `Environment` pane, click ![](images/git_new_branch.png) `New Branch`
1. In branch name, enter your student id
1. You should see a pop-up with the message `Branch 'STUDENT_ID' set up to track remote branch 'STUDENT_ID' from 'origin'.` at the bottom, go ahead and click `Close`
1. Next to where you clicked `New Branch` just before, it should now say `STUDENT_ID`, click it and confirm that you see `STUDENT_ID` and `main`
1. Look at the illustration above and understand that you have created a new branch `STUDENT_ID` that branches out from **<span style="color:green;">main</span>** and is equivalent to **<span style="color:blue;">Your Work</span>**. Discuss this with your group if it is not clear.
1. Click `STUDENT_ID` and you will get a confirmation that you are already on that branch and that you are up-to-date, click `Close`
1. In the `group_document.qmd` under your section, using markdown, enter a new sub-header and name it e.g. `New feature` or `New analysis`. Make sure that you all use the "Visual" editor for the .qmd file!
1. Enter some text, a few code chunks with a bit of `R`-code of your choosing and save the document
1. Again, in the `git` tab, tick the box under staged and click `Commit`
1. Add a commit message, e.g. `New feature from STUDENT_ID` and click `Commit`
1. Click `Close`, `Pull`, `Close`, `Push` and `Close` and then close the commit window
1. Go to your group GitHub and confirm that you now have at least 2 branches
1. Make sure you are in the main branch and then click the `group_document.qmd`, you should now **not** see your new feature/analysis that you added
1. On the left, where it says `main`, click and select your `STUDENT_ID`, you **should** now see your new feature/analysis that you added

*Congratulations! You have now successfully done your first branching!*

### Your first branch merging

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Team</span>**

1. Go to your groups GitHub page, at the top it should say `STUDENT_ID had recent pushes...`, click the `Compare & pull request`
1. Your commit message will appear and where it says `Leave a comment`, add a comment like e.g. `I'm done, all seems to be working now!` or similar
1. Click `Create pull request`
1. It should now say `This branch have no conflicts with the base branch`, confirm and click `Merge pull request`
1. Click `Confirm merge` after which it should now say `Pull request successfully merged and closed`
1. You have now fully merged, so go ahead and click `Delete branch`
1. Revisit the previous illustration and compare with your branch workflow, make sure that everyone in the groups are on par here
1. Finally return to your RStudio session and make sure you switch to the `main` branch

*Congratulations! You have now successfully done your first branch merge!*

But wait, what was this `Pull request`??? What you actually did, was:
1. Created a new branch
1. Completed a new feature/analysis
1. Push'ed the new feature/analysis to GitHub
1. Created a `Pull request` for merging your branch `STUDENT_ID` into the `main` branch
1. Approved and completed the `Pull request`

Think about e.g. again the `ggplot2` repo, if anyone could create a new branch and then do as described above, then there would be no way of making quality control. Therefore, typically such pull requests will have to be approved by someone. This can either be someone who is close-to-the-code e.g. in the case of `ggplot2`, that'd be someone like Hadley. In a company, then that might be some senior developer approving junior developers pull requests. At one point you might have seen something like "The main branch is unprotected", this is exactly that!

### Your first merge conflict

Okay, that's all good an well. Seems easy and straight forward, right? Well, that is as long as we don't have a *conflict*. A conflict is when two or more changes to one file are not compatible. In fact, let's screw things up! We will be working with this file:

```{verbatim}
Top 10 Bio Data Science Languages of ALL Time:
10. It is 
9. Impossible
8. to rank them
7. Because
6. programming is subjective
5. and everyone
4. has
3. different
2. tastes
1. R
```

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Captain</span>**

1. Go to the RStudio session and where you usually click `Quarto Document...`, this time let's just create a simple `Text File`
1. Copy/paste the `Top 10 Bio Data Science Languages of ALL Time` into the file
1. Save the file as `best_ds_langs.txt`
1. Make sure you are in the `main` branch
1. Do a commit/pull/push and check the file can be seen in your group's GitHub repo

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Crew</span>**

Rrrrrrr... Let's commit mutiny! (Double pun intended)

1. Make sure you are in the `main` branch and then hit `Pull`
2. Open the `best_ds_langs.txt`
3. Each of you separately (wrongfully) replace `R` with an (inferior) bio data science language of your choice
4. Then commit, pull and push.
5. The first crewmember to push will have succeeded. But if you weren't so lucky, you will now be notified about a *merge conflict*. Close and re-open the `best_ds_langs.txt` file, it should look something like:

```{verbatim}
Top 10 Bio Data Science Languages of ALL Time:
10. It is 
9. Impossible
8. to rank them
7. Because
6. programming is subjective
5. and everyone
4. has
3. different
2. tastes
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

<details>
<p><summary>`git`'s merge conflict syntax</summary></p>
A *merge conflict* happens when you try to pull from a repository that has had changes in the same lines of a file that you have also changed. Git doesn’t know which version to pick, so it asks you to resolve it. When such conflicts occur, `git` leaves markers in the file, showing:

- Everything below `<<<<<<<` is your current changes (`HEAD` means "your current commit")
- `=======` is simply the separator between the 2 versions
- Everything above `>>>>>>>` is the version you are pulling. That long "random" code is called the *commit hash* and is a unique identifier for each commit in your git repository. You can use this code to return back (or go forward to) any committed version of your code.
</details>


6. Keep only your preferred Bio Data Science language and also remove the lines containing `<<<<<<<`, `=======` and `>>>>>>>`

*Congratulations! You have now fixed your first merge conflict!*

7. You will need to commit your changes again before pulling and pushing. However, if another crewmemeber has (again) pushed before you, you will have yet another merge conflict to solve! Return to step 5 if that is the case. This is the chaos of mutiny and why a well organized team and modular code are critical for collaborative software development.

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Captain</span>**

Get your **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Crew</span>** in order!

1. Pull the changes made by your crew and simply edit the file so that you delete everything below 2. and add the final line, which emphasises that `1. R is superior!`
1. Commit your changes and add a commit message, e.g. `Got crew back in order!`
1. Pull and Push to the GitHub repo
1. Return to your GitHub repository and confirm all is in order and that you can continue with confidence knowing that `R is superior!` (Check the file to make sure)

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">Team</span>**

1. Pull from RStudio and make sure that your `best_ds_langs.txt` has the changes that your captain just made.
1. Click the `History` button next to the `Push` button and explore the history of how your branches and commits have changed through these exercises. Discuss with your group what you see.

### The .gitignore file

You may have noticed the `.gitignore` file?

#### **<span style="color:darkgreen;">One crew member</span>**

1. Go to your RStudio session, find the `.gitignore` file and click it

It contains a list of files and folders, which should **not** end up at your `git` repo, i.e. files which should be ignored. An important aspect of working with GitHub is that GitHub is meant for code, **not** data! Let's say we had a `data` and a `data/_raw/`, we could add those to the `.gitignore` file to avoid the data being included in our commits. Currently, files like `.RData` and folders like `.Rproj.user` should be listed in the `.gitignore` file, as these are unique to each of your own sessions and shouldn't be committed to the repo.

2. Update the `.gitignore` file with the suggestions above and get the updated version to GitHub (we'll assume you know how to do that by now 😉).

### Summary

You have now gotten to play around with collaborative coding using `git` - Well done!

If you are more curious for more, please feel free to play around with a new file, edit commit/pull/push etc. Perhaps also 
take an extra look at the GitHub, explore and learn more 👍 We have also only just scratched the surface here, you can read 
much more [here](https://happygitwithr.com).

If you are handy with the terminal, it is a good idea to learn how to use `git` from the terminal. The 
[Primer on git command line vs. RStudio](primer_git_cli.qmd) shows the equivalent git commands of everything 
we have done in these exercises.

### <span style="color: red;">GROUP ASSIGNMENT</span> (Important, see: [how to](assignments.qmd))

Your assignment this time, will be to:

1. Go to [this post](https://clauswilke.com/blog/2020/09/07/pca-tidyverse-style/) on "PCA tidyverse style" by Claus O. Wilke, Professor of Integrative Biology
1. Again, create a reproducible micro-report *together*, this time, where you do a code-along with either the data in the post, the `gravier` data, and/or any other dataset.
1. Use your GitHub group repository to collaborate - you should all contribute. Again, make sure that you are using the "Visual" editor while working on this!
1. Your hand in will be a link to your micro-report in your GitHub group repository
1. *Note, focus here is on the `git` learning objectives and doing a code-along, which is not a copy/paste of the code, but using it as inspiration to create your own nice concise **tidy** micro-report!*
1. Make sure to check the [Assignment Guidelines](https://r4bds.github.io/assignments.html)
1. And also follow the [Course Code Styling](https://r4bds.github.io/code_styling.html)
1. **HOW TO HAND IN**: Go to `http://github.com/rforbiodatascienceYY/groupXX`, replace `YY` with year and `groupXX` with appropriate group number, then copy the link and paste it into an empty text (.txt) file. Hand in this text file. **No need to zip your html file,** since we are accessing it through the repository!
