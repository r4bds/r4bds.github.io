## Getting Started

_First of all, make sure to read every line in these exercises carefully!_

_If you get stuck with Quarto, revisit [R4DS2e: Chapter 28 Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) or [take a look at the Comprehensive guide to using Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)_

- Go to the [R for Bio Data Science RStudio Cloud Server](https://teaching.healthtech.dtu.dk/22100/rstudio.php) session from last time and log in and choose the project you created.

- **Create a new Quarto Document for today's exercises, e.g. lab02_exercises.qmd**

Recall the layout of the IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

![](images/lab01_04.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

Then, before we start, we need to fetch some data to work on.

- See if you can figure out how to create a new folder called "data", make sure to place it the same place as your my_project_name.Rproj file.

Then, without further ado, run each of the following lines separately in your _console_:

```{r}
#| eval: false
target_url <- "https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray/raw/master/data/gravier.RData"
output_file <- "data/gravier.RData"
curl::curl_download(url = target_url,
                    destfile = output_file)
```

- Using the `files` pane, check the folder you created to see if you managed to retrieve the file.

Recall the syntax for a new code chunk:

```{verbatim}
  ```{r}
  #| echo: true
  #| eval: true
  # Here goes the code... Note how this part does not get executed because of the initial hashtag, this is called a code-comment
  1 + 1
  my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
  my_mean <- mean(my_vector)
  print(my_mean)
  ```
```

IMPORTANT! You are mixing code and text in a Quarto Document! Anything within a "chunk" as defined above will be evaluated as code, whereas anything outside the chunks is markdown. You can use shortcuts to insert new code chunks:

- Mac: CMD + OPTION + i
- Windows: CTRL + ALT + i

Note, this might not work, depending on your browser. In that case you can insert a new code chunk using ![](images/insert_new_chunk) or You can change the shortcuts via “Tools” > “Modify Keyboard shortcuts…” > Filter for “Insert Chunk” and then choose the desired shortcut. E.g. change the shortcut for code chunks to Shift+Cmd+i or similar.

- Add a new code chunk and use the `load()` function to load the data you retrieved.

<details>
<p><summary>Click here for a hint</summary></p>
Remember, you can use `?load` to get help on how the function works and remember your project root path is defined by the location of your `.Rproj` file, i.e. the path. A path is simply where `R` can find your file, e.g. `/home/projects/r_for_bio_data_science/` or similar depending on your particular setup.
</details>

Now, in the console, run the `ls()` command and confirm, that you did indeed load the `gravier` data.

- Read the information about the `gravier` data [here](https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray/wiki/Gravier-%282010%29)

Now, in your Quarto Document, add a new code chunk like so

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library("tidyverse")
```

This will load our data science toolbox, including `ggplot`.

## Create data

Before we can visualise the data, we need to wrangle it a bit. Nevermind the details here, we will get to that later. Just create a new chunk, copy/paste the below code and run it:

```{r}
set.seed(676571)
cancer_data=mutate(as_tibble(pluck(gravier,"x")),y=pluck(gravier,"y"),pt_id=1:length(pluck(gravier, "y")),age=round(rnorm(length(pluck(gravier,"y")),mean=55,sd=10),1))
cancer_data=rename(cancer_data,event_label=y)
cancer_data$age_group=cut(cancer_data$age,breaks=seq(10,100,by=10))
cancer_data=relocate(cancer_data,c(pt_id,age,age_group,pt_id,event_label))
```

Now we have the data set as a tibble, which is an augmented data frame (we will also get to that later):

```{r}
cancer_data
```

* __Q1: What is this data?__

<details>
<p><summary>Click here for a hint</summary></p>
_Where did the data come from?_
</details>

* __Q2: How many rows and columns are there in the data set in total?__

<details>
<p><summary>Click here for a hint</summary></p>
_Do you think you are the first person in the world to try to find out how many rows and columns are in a data set in `R`?_
</details>

* __Q3: Which are the variables and which are the observations in relation to rows and columns?__

## ggplot - The Very Basics

### General Syntax

The general syntax for a basic `ggplot` is:

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = my_data,
       mapping = aes(x = variable_1_name,
                     y = variable_2_name)) +
  geom_something() +
  labs()
```

Note the `+` for adding layers to the plot

- `ggplot` the plotting function
- `my_data` the data you want to plot
- `aes()` the mappings of your data to the plot
- `x` data for the x-axis
- `y` data for the y-axis
- `geom_something()` the representation of your data
- `labs()` the x-/y-labels, title, etc.

Now:

- Revisit this illustration and discuss in your group what is what:

![](images/vis_ggplot_components.png)

A very handy `ggplot` cheat-sheet can be found [here](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf)

### Basic Plots

Remember to write notes in your Quarto document. You will likely revisit these basic plots in future exercises.

Primer: Plotting 2 x 20 random normally distributed numbers, can be done like so:

```{r}
ggplot(data = tibble(x = rnorm(20),
                     y = rnorm(20)),
       mapping = aes(x = x,
                     y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

Using this small primer, the materials you read for today and the `cancer_data` you created, in separate code-chunks, create a:

* __T1: scatter plot of one variable against another__
* __T2: line graph of one variable against another__
* __T3: box plot of one variable__ (_Hint: Set `x = "my_gene"` in `aes()`_)
* __T4: histogram of one variable__
* __T5: densitogram of one variable__

Remember to write notes to yourself, so you know what you did and if there is something in particular you want to remember.

* __Q4: Do all geoms require both `x` and `y?`__

### Extending Basic Plots

* __T6: Pick your favourite gene and create a box plot of expression levels stratified on the variable `event_label`__

* __T7: Like T6, but with densitograms__ <span style="color: red;">GROUP ASSIGNMENT</span>

* __T8: Pick your favourite gene and create a box plot of expression levels stratified on the variable `age_group`__
    * Then, add stratification on `event_label`
    * Then, add transparency to the boxes
    * Then, add some labels

* __T9: Pick your favourite gene and create a scatter plot of expression levels versus `age`__
    * Then, add stratification on `event_label`
    * Then, add a smoothing line
    * Then, add some labels

* __T10: Pick your favourite two genes and create a scatter plot of their expression levels__
    * Then, add stratification on `event_label`
    * Then, add a smoothing line
    * Then, show split into seperate panes based on the variable `age_group`
    * Then, add some labels
    * Change the `event_label` title of the legend

* __T11: Recreate the following plot__

```{r}
#| echo: false
cancer_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = event_label, y = g1CNS507, fill = event_label)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5,
               show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Event After Diagnosis",
       y = "Expression level of g1CNS507 (log2 transformed)",
       title = "A prognostic DNA signature for T1T2 node-negative breast cancer patients",
       subtitle = "Labelling: good = no event, poor = early metastasis",
       caption = "Data from Gravier et al. (2010)")
```

* __Q5: Using your biological knowledge, what is your interpretation of the plot?__

* __T12: Recreate the following plot__

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
cancer_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = g1int239, fill = event_label)) +
  geom_point(pch = 21) +
  geom_smooth(aes(colour = event_label), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Subject Age",
       y = "Expression level of g1int239 (log2 transformed)",
       title = "A prognostic DNA signature for T1T2 node-negative breast cancer patients",
       subtitle = "Stratified on labelling: good = no event, poor = early metastasis",
       caption = "Data from Gravier et al. (2010)",
       fill = "Label",
       colour = "Label") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

* __Q6: Using your biological knowledge, what is your interpretation of the plot?__

* __T13: If you arrive here and there is still time left for the exercises, you are probably already familiar with `ggplot` - Use what time is left to challenge yourself to further explore the `cancer_data` and create some nice data visualisations - Show me what you come up with!__
