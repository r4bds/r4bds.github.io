    "text": "A tidy approach to wrangling, exploring, visualising and communicating bio data with an emphasis on doing collaborative and reproducible bioinformatics projects \nLeon Eyrich Jessen & the TA team\n\nWelcome to R for Bio Data Science\nSo, you signed up for the 22100/22160 bioinformatics study line course - Congratulations! That was your first step towards getting a set of bio data science skills, which will serve you through your future career regardless of your path!\nInspirational quotes can be cliche, however this one hits the nail on the head:\n\n“Think about the readability of your code. Every project your work on is fundamentally collaborative. Even if you are not working with any other person, you are always working with future you and you really do not want to be in a situation where future you has no idea what past you was thinking, because past you will not respond to any emails!” Hadley Wickham\n\nBio Data Science in intrinsically collaborative (even if it’s just you working) and intrinsically interdisciplinary, so collaborative-, reproducibility- and communication- skills are key. In this course, you will learn how to do modern project oriented collaborative bio data science in tidyverse R - Welcome!"

    "text": "The course is designed as a semi-flipped classroom, with an emphasis on active learning. This means that during the 4h classes, the first hour will be dedicated to reviewing key points from last week and then a brief introduction to the topic of the day followed by a break. Hereafter, the students will work hands-on in groups on computational exercises using cloud computing infrastructure. The exercises will rely on relevant bioinformatics data from publicly available databases and gradually build the students toolbox with an emphasis on collaborative project work. This part will take up the first 9 labs. Each lab is defined by a set of specified learning objectives, it is essential that students continuously make sure, that they are on track with these LOs.\nThe fist hour of the 10th lab is dedicated to introducing the project part of the course and the subsequent 3h are dedicated to a mini symposium on “Application of R for Bio Data Science in Industry”. Here students will get a change to get insights into how the course topics are implemented in industry and get a glimpse into what options are available upon completing their education. This hybrid event typically attracts ~250 participants and have featured talks from major national and international Pharma/biotech companies, such as: Novo Nordisk, Lundbeck, Chr. Hansen, Bristol Meyer Squibb, a.o.\nIn the project part of the course, students will form groups of 4-5 students based on common interests. Hereafter, the students will seek out and select a data set, which will form the foundation for the project work. In the project work, the students will go through the entire data science cycle and produce the code base for a complete bioinformatics project. This entails a complete synthesis of all components of the exercise labs and supports the collaborative aspect. The groups must then condense the project into a presentation, thereby addressing communicative competencies as an essential part of being a modern bio data scientist."

    "text": "Exercises\nToday, we will focus on getting you started and up and running with the first elements of the course, namely the RStudio IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) and Quarto. If the relationship between R and RStudio is unclear, think of it this way: Consider a car, in that case, R would be the engine and RStudio would be the rest of the car. Neither is particularly useful, but together they form a functioning unit. Before you continue, make sure you in fact did watch the “RStudio for the Total Beginner” video (See the Learning Materials for today’s session).\n\nCloud server and the RStudio IDE\nGo to the R for Bio Data Science Cloud Server and follow the login procedure. Upon login, you will see this:\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, just a quick change of settings to enable graphics. Click Tools \\(\\rightarrow\\) Global Options. Then under General, choose the tab Graphics and under Graphics Device, choose Cairo as your Backend. Then click Apply and finally OK. That was easy right? Now, please continue.\nWelcome to the RStudio IDE. It allows you to consolidate all features needed to develop R code for analysis. Now, click Tools \\(\\rightarrow\\) Global Options... \\(\\rightarrow\\) Pane Layout and you will see this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis outlines the four panes you have in your RStudio IDE and allow you rearrange them as you please. Now, re-arrange them, so that they look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Apply \\(\\rightarrow\\) OK and you should see this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst steps\n\nThe Console\nNow, in the console, as you saw in the video, you can type commands like:\n\n2+2\n1:100\n3*3\nsample(1:9)\nX <- matrix(sample(1:9), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)\nX\nsum(X)\nmean(X)\n?sum\nsum\nnucleotides <- c(\"a\", \"c\", \"g\", \"t\")\nnucleotides\nsample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE)\ntable(sample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE))\npaste0(sample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE), collapse = \"\")\nreplicate(n = 10, expr = paste0(sample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE), collapse = \"\"))\ndf <- data.frame(id = paste0(\"seq\", 1:10), seq = replicate(n = 10, expr = paste0(sample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE), collapse = \"\")))\ndf\nstr(df)\nls()\n\nTake some time and play around with these commands and other things you can come up with. Use the ?function to get help on what that function does. Be sure to discuss what you observe in the console. Do not worry too much about the details for now; we are just getting started. But as you hopefully can see, R is very flexible and basically the message is: “If you can think it, you can build it in R”.\n\nGo to R4DS2e Chapter 2 Workflow: basics in R4DS2e and do the exercises\n\n\n\nThe Terminal\nNotice how in the console pane, you also get a Terminal, click and enter:\n\nls\nmkdir tmp\ntouch tmp/test.txt\nls tmp\nrm tmp/test.txt\nrmdir tmp\nls\necho $SHELL\n\nBasically, here you have access to a full terminal, which can prove immensely useful! Note, you may or may not be familiar with the concept of a terminal. Simply think of it as a way to interact with the computer using text command, rather than clicking on icons etc. Click back to the console.\n\n\nThe Source\nThe source is where you will write scripts. A script is a series of commands to be executed sequentially, i.e. first line 1, then line 2 and so on. Right now, you should have a open script called Untitled1. If not, you can create a new script by clicking white paper with a round green plus sign in the upper left corner.\nTaking inspiration from the examples above, try to write a series of commands and include a print()-statement at the very end. Click File \\(\\rightarrow\\) Save and save the file as e.g. my_first_script.R. Now, go to the console and type in the command source(\"my_first_script.R\"). Congratulations! You have now written your very first reproducible R program!\n\n\n\nThe Whole Shebang\nEnough playing around, let us embark on our modern Bio Data Science in R journey.\n\nIn the Files pane, click New Folder and create a folder called projects\nIn the upper right corner, click where it says Project: (None) and then click New Project...\nClick New Directory and then New Project\nIn the Directory name:, enter e.g. r_for_bio_data_science\nClick the Browse... button and select your newly created projects directory and then click Choose\nClick Create Project and wait a bit for it to get created\n\n\nOn Working in Projects\nProjects allow you to create fully transferable bio data science projects, meaning that the root of the project will be where the .Rproj file is located. You can confirm this by entering getwd() in the console. This means that under no circumstances should you ever not work within a project, nor should you ever use absolute paths. Every single path you state in your project must be relative to the project root.\nBut why? Imagine you have created a project, where you have indeed used absolute paths. Now you want to share that project with a colleague. Said colleague gets your project and tests the reproducibility by running the project end-to-end. But it completely fails because you have hardcoded your paths to be absolute, meaning that all file and project resource locations point to locations on your laptop.\nProjects are a must and allow you to create reproducible encapsulated bio data science projects. Note, the concept of reproducibility is absolutely central to this course and must be considered in all aspects of the life cycle of a project!\n\n\nQuarto\nWhile .R-scripts are a perfectly valid way to write scripts, there is another Skywalker:\n\nIn the upper left corner, again, click the white paper with the round green plus, but this time select Quarto Document\nEnter a Title:, e.g. “Lab 1 Exercises” and enter your name below in the box Author:\nClick Create\nImportant: Save your Quarto document! Click File \\(\\rightarrow\\) Save and name it e.g. lab_01_exercises.qmd\nMinimise the Environment pane\n\nYou should now see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nTry clicking the Render button just above the quarto-document. This will create the HTML5 output file. Note! You may get a Connection Refused message. If so, don’t worry, just close the page to return to the cloud server and find the generated .html file, left-click and select View in Web Browser.\nIf you have previously worked with Rmarkdown, then many features of Quarto will be familiar. Think of Quarto as a complete rethinking of Rmarkdown, i.e. based on all the experience gained, what would the optimal way of constructing an open-source scientific and technical publishing system?\nIf you have previously encountered Jupyter notebooks, Quarto is similar. The basic idea is to have one document covering the entire project cycle.\nProceed to R4DS2e Chapter 28 Quarto and do the exercises.\n\n\n\nBio Data Science with a Virtual AI Assistant\nI am pretty sure you all know of ChatGPT by now, so let us address the elephant in the room!\n\nGetting started\n\nGo to the ChatGPT site\nCreate a user and log in\n\n\nLet us get acquainted\nNow, at the bottom it says “Send a message”, let us ask 3 simple question and see if we can find out what is what. Type the following questions in the prompt and read the answers:\n\nExplain in simple terms what you are\nExplain in simple terms how you work\nExplain in simple terms how you can be used to generate value as a virtual AI assistant, when doing Bio Data Science for R\nWhat is chatGPT and abbreviation for?\n\n\n\nMoving onto R\nIn the upper left corner, click ChatGPT it to start a new session.\nAgain, type the following questions in the prompt and read the answers:\n\nR\nWhat is R?\nGive a few simple examples\nExplain the difference between base R and Tidyverse R\n\nIf you get some code examples, try copying and pasting them into the console in RStudio to see if they run.\n\n\nPrompt Engineering\nStart a new chat and enter:\n\nGive a few simple examples\n\nCompare the response with the one from before, is it the same or different and why so?\nDiscuss in your group what is “Prompt Engineering” and how does it relate to the above few tests you did? (Bonus info: Prompt engineer is already a job and people are making money off of selling “prompts”)\n\n\n…a bit more\nStart a new chat and enter:\n\nTell me about DNA\n\nCheck if it gives you correct information?\nNow, write:\n\nGive a few fun examples on how to get started with the R programming language using DNA\nCopy/paste the code into the Console, do the examples all run?\nDiscuss in your group if you understand what is going on\nEarlier you were told to play around with some code snippets. Perhaps you didn’t fully catch what was going on? If so, try to type in e.g.:\n\nI'm new to R, please explain in simple terms, what the following code does:\n\n\"\nnucleotides <- c(\"a\", \"c\", \"g\", \"t\")\nreplicate(n = 10, expr = paste0(sample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE), collapse = \"\"))\n\"\n\nNow, you could also ask a question like this:\n\nI am a student in the course \"R for Bio Data Science\" and we have been asked to solve the following problem:\n\n\"\nNow it is time to take it a step further. A) Create a function, which returns random RNA of length 'l' and B) another function, which performs reverse transcription.\n\"\n\nPlease give me the solution to the problem\n\nTry to run the code, you were presumable given. Likely, the tasks have been solved, but did you actually learn something? Do you understand the details of the code?\n\n\n\nStrawberry Fields Forever\nStart yet a new chat and run:\n\nHow many Rs are there in the word strawberry?\nHow many Rs are there in the word strawberries?\nWhat is the difference between strawberry and strawberries?\nTry as above, but using ‘raspberry’ and ‘cranberry’\nInspect the answers, did ChatGPT get these simple questions right?\n\n\n\nSummary\nThe following is IMPORTANT, so please read carefully and please discuss in your group\nWhile ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for code productivity, it comes with a major caveat: When it fails, it fails with confidence (See Strawberry Fields Forever above). This means that it will be equally confident whether it is right or wrong! The optimal yield is when you are working on a problem with a tool, where you already have a good knowledge of the problem and the tool. Here, you can use your experience to evaluate if you are heading in the right direction or if you’re being send on a wild goose chase. In this situation, ChatGPT can be a powerful sparring partner to augment your bio data science workflow to enhance productivity.\nKnow the difference between “asking for a solution” and “asking for an explanation” - Do not cheat yourself here, it is very important that the yield of this course is that you learn Tidyverse R and not how to “use ChatGPT to produced code”.\nTherefore, do not use ChatGPT to solve the exercises, rather use ChatGPT as a learning assistant. Here is an example of the difference:\n\nWrong: Give me the tidyverse code for adding a new variable z to a dataset, which is the sum of x and y\nRight: In simple terms, explain which tidyverse function is used to add variables to datasets and give a very basic example of how it is used\n\nThe wrong way will give you the solution directly, robbing you of the learning process of internalising the functionality and the translation of the general explanation to the specific application to your problem. The right way, will allow you to work with your understanding of the problem and how to translate the general explation into a specific solution to your problem."

    "text": "Getting Started\nFirst of all, make sure to read every line in these exercises carefully!\nIf you get stuck with Quarto, revisit R4DS2e: Chapter 28 Quarto or take a look at the Comprehensive guide to using Quarto\nIf you get stuck working with paths and projects, remember there is a primer to help you, see the preparations materials for this session\n\nGo to the R for Bio Data Science RStudio Cloud Server session from last time and log in and choose the project you created.\nMake sure you are working in the right project, check in the upper right corner, it should say r_for_bio_data_science\nCreate a NEW Quarto Document for today’s exercises, e.g. lab02_exercises.qmd and remember to SAVE it in the same location as your .Rproj-file\n\nRecall the layout of the IDE (Integrated Development Environment)\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, before we start, we need to fetch some data to work on.\n\nSee if you can figure out how to create a new folder called “data”, make sure to place it the same place as your r_for_bio_data_science.Rproj file.\n\nThen, without further ado, run each of the following lines separately in your console:\n\ntarget_url <- \"https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray/raw/master/data/gravier.RData\"\noutput_file <- \"data/gravier.RData\"\ncurl::curl_download(url = target_url, destfile = output_file)\n\n\n\n\nClick here for a hint if you get an error along the lines of Failed to open file...\n\n\nThink about what we are doing here. If you look at the code chunk above, then you can see that we are setting a variable target_url, which defines “a location on the internet”. From here we want to download some data. We need to tell R, where to put this data, so we also define the output_file-variable. Then we call the function curl_download() from the curl-package, hence the notation curl::curl_download(). As arguments to the function-parameters url and destfile, we pass the aforementioned variables. So far so good. Now, look at the target_url- and the output_file-variables, which one of those are we responsible for? If you think about it - We cannot change the target_url, we can only change the output_file, so there is a good chance, that the error you are getting pertains to this variable. But what does the variable contain? It contains the path to where you want to place the file, that is the data/-part and then it contains the filename you want to use, that is the gravier-part and then finally, it contains the filetype you want to use, that is the .RData-part. The filename and filetype is up to you to choose, but the path… Well, R can only find that if it exists… So… Did you remember to create a folder data in the same location as your r_for_bio_data_science.Rproj-file? If this small intermezzo has left things even more unclear, you should go over the primer on paths and projects. Remember, if at first you don’t succeed - Try and try again!\n\n\nUsing the files pane, check the folder you created to see if you managed to retrieve the file.\n\nRecall the syntax for a new code chunk:\n  ```{r}\n  #| echo: true\n  #| eval: true\n  # Here goes the code... Note how this part does not get executed because of the initial hashtag, this is called a code-comment\n  1 + 1\n  my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)\n  my_mean <- mean(my_vector)\n  print(my_mean)\n  ```\nIMPORTANT! You are mixing code and text in a Quarto Document! Anything within a “chunk” as defined above will be evaluated as code, whereas anything outside the chunks is markdown. You can use shortcuts to insert new code chunks:\n\nMac: CMD + OPTION + i\nWindows: CTRL + ALT + i\n\nNote, this might not work, depending on your browser. In that case you can insert a new code chunk using  or You can change the shortcuts via “Tools” > “Modify Keyboard shortcuts…” > Filter for “Insert Chunk” and then choose the desired shortcut. E.g. change the shortcut for code chunks to Shift+Cmd+i or similar.\n\nAdd a new code chunk and use the load() function to load the data you retrieved.\n\n\n\n\nClick here for a hint\n\n\nRemember, you can use ?load to get help on how the function works and remember your project root path is defined by the location of your .Rproj file, i.e. the path. A path is simply where R can find your file, e.g. /home/projects/r_for_bio_data_science/ or similar depending on your particular setup.\n\nNow, in the console, run the ls() command and confirm, that you did indeed load the gravier data.\n\nRead the information about the gravier data here\n\nNow, in your Quarto Document, add a new code chunk like so\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n\nThis will load our data science toolbox, including ggplot."

The Quarto document MUST be placed together with your .Rproj file (defining, the project root - look in your Files tab) and also there, the data-folder should be placed!\nREMEMBER paths are important! Also, R is case-sensitive, i.e. “data” is not the same as “Data”\n\nSee Paths and Projects\n\n\nThe here package as your friendly neighborhood path helper\nPaths can be tricky and as you have seen, some file formats cough .qmd’s cough, may not really feel that strongly about your project setup, so… The here package to the rescue.\nIf you decided to put your qmd-file in e.g. an exercises-directory, which is a very nice and perfectly understandable idea, then you will find that the following chunk will not work:\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nload(file = \"data/gravier.RData\") # Nope!\n\nSo here is the trick, here keeps track of your project root, as defined by the .Rproj-file. So the following will work even if you have your .qmd-files in other directories:\n\nlibrary(\"here\")\nload(file = here(\"data/gravier.RData\")) # Yup!\n\nEnjoy your friendly neighborhood path helper!\n\n\nGetting the data\nAdd a new code chunk and add the following code (Never mind the details, we will get back to this), remember you can use headers to nicely section your quarto Document.\n\nbase_url <- \"http://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological/\"\nraw_data_path <- \"data/_raw/\"\n\nSPE <- read_csv(file = str_c(base_url, \"SPE_pitlatrine.csv\"))\nwrite_csv(x = SPE,\n          file = str_c(raw_data_path, \"SPE_pitlatrine.csv\"))\n\nENV <- read_csv(file = str_c(base_url, \"ENV_pitlatrine.csv\"))\nwrite_csv(x = ENV,\n          file = str_c(raw_data_path, \"ENV_pitlatrine.csv\"))\n\nAdd the chunk settings #| echo: true and #| eval: true, then run the block and change the latter to #| eval: false.\n\nDiscuss in your group, what this means and why we do it\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nWhere do we retrieve the data from, where do we write it to, and what happens if we run the chunk more than one time?\n\n\n\nWrangling the data\n\nWhat is data wrangling?\n\nBefore we continue with plotting, we want to unify the data, so here again you will run some code, where the details are not important right now.\nBut… Make sure, that you have run library(\"tidyverse\") somewhere in your Quarto document - Perhaps under an initial header saying “Load Libraries” or similar?\n\nSPE |> \n  pivot_longer(cols = -Taxa,\n               names_to = \"Samples\",\n               values_to = \"OTU_Count\")  |> \n  full_join(ENV, by = \"Samples\") |> \n  mutate(site = case_when(str_detect(Samples, \"^T\") ~ \"Tanzania\",\n                          str_detect(Samples, \"^V\") ~ \"Vietnam\")) |>  \n  write_tsv(file = \"data/SPE_ENV.tsv\")\n\nChange the chunk settings as before"

Any text and notes must be outside the chunk tags:\n\n```{r}\n# Here the code goes\n1 + 1\nx <- c(1, 2, 3)\nmean(x)\n```\n\n[1] 2\n[1] 2\n\n\nOur markdown goes outside the code-chunks, e.g.:\n  # Header level 1\n  ## Header level 2\n  ### Header level 3\n  *A text in italics*\n  **A text in bold**\n  Normal text describing and explaining\nNow, in your new Quarto document, create a new Header level 2, e.g.:\n  ## Load Libraries\nand under your new header, add a new code chunk, like so\n\n```{r}\n#| message: false\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n\nAnd run the chunk. This will load our data science toolbox, including dplyr (and ggplot). But wait, what does #| message: false do? 🤷️ 🤔\nTry to structure your Quarto document as your course notes, i.e. add notes while solving the exercises aiming to create a reference that you can revisit for your final project work… And… For future reference after this course, where hopefully you’ll really reap what you sow\nBonus info: We are engineers, so of course, we love equations, we can include standard \\(\\LaTeX\\) syntax, e.g.:\n  $E(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$\nTry it!\n\n\nA few handy short cuts\nInsert new code chunk:\n\nMac: CMD + OPTION + i\nWindows: CTRL + ALT + i\n\nRender my Quarto document:\n\nMac: CMD + SHIFT + k\nWin: CTRL + SHIFT + k\n\nRun line in chunk:\n\nMac: CMD + ENTER\nWin: CTRL + ENTER\n\nRun entire chunk:\n\nMac: CMD + SHIFT + ENTER\nWin: CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER\n\nInsert the pipe symbol |>:\n\nMac: CMD + SHIFT + m\nWin: CTRL + SHIFT + m\n\nNote, if you’re trying this out and you see %>% instead of |>, then go to Tools, Global Options..., Code and check the box Use native pipeoperator, |>"

Note, if you click the -button, you will get a spreadsheet-like view of the data, allowing you to get an overview (Psst… No need to use Excel…).\n\nQ1: How many observations and how many variables?\nQ2: Is this a tidy data set? Which three rules must be satisfied?\nQ3: When you run the chunk, then underneath each column name is stated <chr> and <dbl> what is that?\n\nBefore we continue\n\nT1: Change the height, weight, waist and hip from the imperial system (inches/pounds) to the metric system (cm/kg), rounding to 1 decimal\n\n\n\n\nLet us try to take a closer look at various subsets of the data. For the following questions, “How many …” refers to the number of rows in the subset of the data you create:\n\nQ4: How many weigh less than 100kg?\nQ5: How many weigh more than 100kg?\nQ6: How many weigh more than 100kg and are less than 1.6m tall?\nQ7: How many women are taller than 1.8m?\nQ8: How many men are taller than 1.8m?\nQ9: How many women in Louisa are older than 30?\nQ10: How many men in Buckingham are younger than 30 and taller than 1.9m?\nT2: Make a scatter plot of weight versus height and colour by sex for inhabitants of Louisa above the age of 40\nT3: Make a box plot of height versus location stratified on sex for people above the age of 50\n\nSorting columns can aid in getting an overview of variable ranges (don’t use the summary() function yet for this one)\n\nQ11: How old is the youngest person?\nQ12: How old is the oldest person?\nQ13: Of all the 20-year-olds, what is the height of the tallest?\nQ14: Of all the 20-year-olds, what is the height of the shortest?\n\nChoosing specific columns can be used to work with a subset of the data for a specific purpose\n\nQ15: How many columns (variables) starts_with a “b”?\nQ16: How many columns (variables) contains the word “eight”?\n\nCreating new variables is an integral part of data manipulation\n\nT4: Create a new variable, where you calculate the BMI\n\n\n\n\n\nT5: Create a BMI_class variable\n\nTake a look at the following code snippet to get you started:\n\ntibble(x = rnorm(10)) |> \n  mutate(trichotomised = case_when(\n    x < -1 ~ \"Less than -1\",\n    -1 <= x & x < 1 ~ \"larger than or equal to -1 and smaller than 1\",\n    1 <= x ~ \"Larger than or equal to 1\"))\n\nand then go read about BMI classification here and discuss in your group how to extract classifications from the Definition/Introduction section\nNote, the cut() function could be used here, but you should try to use case_when() as illustrated in the example chunk above.\n\n\n\nOnce you have created the variable, you will need to convert it to a categorical variable, in R, these are called a factor and you can set the levels like so:\n\ndiabetes_data <- diabetes_data |>\n  mutate(BMI_class = factor(BMI_class,\n                            levels =  c(\"my 1st category\", \"my 2nd category\",\n                                        \"my 3rd category\", \"my nth category\")))\n\nThis is very important for plotting, as this will determine the order in which the categories appear on the plot!\n\nT6: Create a box plot of hdl versus BMI_class\nQ17: What do you see?\nT7: Create a BFP (Body fat percentage) variable\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nBFP can be calculated using the following equation from Jackson et al. (2002):\n\\[BFP = 1.39 \\cdot BMI + 0.16 \\cdot age - 10.34 \\cdot sex - 9\\]\nwhere \\(sex\\) is defined as being \\(0\\) for female and \\(1\\) for male.\n\n\n\n\n\nT8: Create a WHR (waist-to-hip ratio) variable\nQ18: What correlates better with BMI: WHR or BFP? GROUP ASSIGNMENT (Important, see: how to)\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nIs there a certain plot-type, which can visualise if the relationship between two variables and give insights to if they are correlated? Can you perhaps use an R function to compute the “correlation coefficient”?. Do not use e.g. ggpubr or any other and-then-magic-happens package, use the knowledge you’ve gained so far)\n\nNow, with this augmented data set, let us create some summary statistics\n\nQ19: How many women and men are there in the data set?\nQ20: How many women and men are there from Buckingham and Louisa respectively in the data set?\nQ21: How many are in each of the BMI_class groups?\nQ22: Given the code below, explain the difference between A and B?\n\n\n# A\ndiabetes_data |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = BMI_class)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n# B\ndiabetes_data |>\n  count(BMI_class) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = BMI_class, y = n)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\nT9: For each BMI_class group, calculate the average weight and associated standard deviation\nQ23: What was the average age of the women living in Buckingham in the study?\n\nFinally, if you reach this point and there is still time left. Take some time to do some exploratory plots of the data set and see if you can find something interesting.\n\n\n\n\nJackson, AS, PR Stanforth, J Gagnon, T Rankinen, AS Leon, DC Rao, JS Skinner, C Bouchard, and JH Wilmore. 2002. “The Effect of Sex, Age and Race on Estimating Percentage Body Fat from Body Mass Index: The Heritage Family Study.” International Journal of Obesity 26 (6): 789–96. https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.0802006."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nIn the early 20s, the world was hit by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The pandemic was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In Denmark, the virus first confirmed case was on 27 February 2020.\nWhile initially very little was known about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we did know the general pathology of vira. Briefly, the virus invades the cells and hijacks the intra-cellular machinery. Using the hijacked machinery, components for new virus particles are produced, eventually being packed into the viral envelope and released from the infected cell. Some of these components, viral proteins, is broken down into smaller fragments called peptides by the proteasome. These peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by the Transporter Associated with antigen Processing (TAP) protein complex. Here, they are aided by chaperones bound to the Major Histocompatilibty Complex class I (MHC-I) and then across the Golgi apparatus they finally get displayed on the surface of the cells. Note, in humans, MHC is also called Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) and represents the most diverse genes. Each of us have a total of 6 HLA-alleles, 3 from the maternal and 3 from the paternal side. These are further divided into 3 classes HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C and the combination of these constitute the HLA-haplotype for an individual. Once the peptide is bound to the MHC class I at the cell surface and exposed, the MHC-I peptide complex can be recognised by CD8+ Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs) via the T-cell Receptor (TCR). If a cell displays peptides of viral origin, the CTL gets activated and via a cascade induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the infected cell. The process is summarised in the figure below (McCarthy and Weinberg 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data we will be working with today contains data on sequenced T-cell receptors, viral antigens, HLA-haplotypes and clinical meta data for a cohort:\n\n“A large-scale database of T-cell receptor beta (TCR\\(\\beta\\)) sequences and binding associations from natural and synthetic exposure to SARS-CoV-2” (Nolan et al. 2020)."

Did any variables “disappear” and did any “appear”? Ok, so this is a bit tricky, but perhaps there is a function to separate a composite (untidy) column into a set of new variables based on a separator? But what is a separator? Just like when you read a file with Comma Separated Values, a separator denotes how a composite string is divided into fields. So, look for such a repeated value, which seem to indeed separate such fields. Also, be aware, that character, which can mean more than one thing, may need to be “escaped” using an initial two backslashed, i.e. “\\x”, where x denotes the character needing to be “escaped”\n\n\nT7: Add a variable, which counts how many peptides are in each observation of Amino Acids\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nWe have been working with the stringr package, perhaps the contains a function to somehow count the number of occurrences of a given character in a string?

This we can utilise to work with a smaller data set in the development face and once we are ready, we can increase this n gradually to see if everything continues to work as anticipated.\n\nT11: Using the peptide_data, run a few sample_n() calls with varying degree of n to make sure, that you get a feeling for what is going on\nT12: From the peptide_data data above, with peptide_1, peptide_2, etc. create this data set using one of the data pivoting functions. Remember to start initially with sampling a smaller data set and then work on that first! Also, once you’re sure you’re good to go, reuse the peptide_data variable as we don’t want huge redundant data sets floating around in our environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nIf the pivoting is not clear at all, then do what I do, create some example data:\n\nmy_data <- tibble(\n  id = str_c(\"id_\", 1:10),\n  var_1 = round(rnorm(10),1),\n  var_2 = round(rnorm(10),1),\n  var_3 = round(rnorm(10),1))\n\n…and then play around with that. A small set like the one above is easy to handle, so perhaps start with that and then pivot back and forth a few times using pivot_wider()/pivot_longer(). Use View() to inspect and get a better overview of the results of pivoting.\n\n\npeptide_data |> \n  sample_n(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 7\n   Experiment CDR3b                V_gene    J_gene n_peptides peptide_n peptide\n   <chr>      <chr>                <chr>     <chr>       <dbl> <chr>     <chr>  \n 1 eMR17      CATDWSVAGQGASLNEKLFF TCRBV24-… TCRBJ…          1 peptide_… <NA>   \n 2 eEE224     CSAGQFDRTGNTIYF      TCRBV20-X TCRBJ…          1 peptide_6 <NA>   \n 3 eXL30      CASSFQGYEQYF         TCRBV12-… TCRBJ…          7 peptide_7 YINVFA…\n 4 eMR15      CASSSAYRGNSPLHF      TCRBV27-… TCRBJ…          2 peptide_1 LSPRWY…\n 5 eMR12      CASSLISGQETQYF       TCRBV11-… TCRBJ…          3 peptide_… <NA>   \n 6 eLH48      CASSQVTKDEQFF        TCRBV04-… TCRBJ…          2 peptide_4 <NA>   \n 7 eEE228     CASSPGTLEAFF         TCRBV06-… TCRBJ…         13 peptide_2 FLQSIN…\n 8 eOX52      CASSWTSGGAYEQFF      TCRBV27-… TCRBJ…          2 peptide_… <NA>   \n 9 eOX52      CASSTAPDFEQFF        TCRBV07-… TCRBJ…          1 peptide_1 FVDGVP…\n10 eXL30      CASRGQHSYEQYF        TCRBV27-… TCRBJ…          1 peptide_… <NA>   \n\n\n\nQ7: You will see some NAs in the peptide variable, discuss in your group from where these arise?\nQ8: How many rows and columns now and how does this compare with Q3?

So:\n\nQ13: Discuss in your group, which variable(s?) define the same observations between the peptide_data and the meta_data?\n\nOnce you have agreed upon Experiment, then use that knowledge to subset the meta_data to the variables-of-interest:\n\n\n\n\nmeta_data |> \n  sample_n(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   Experiment Allele      \n   <chr>      <chr>       \n 1 eQD108     \"B*52:01:01\"\n 2 eJL151     \"A*24:02:01\"\n 3 eQD139     \"B*57:01:01\"\n 4 eHO141     \"\"          \n 5 eQD112     \"C*04:01:01\"\n 6 eJL154     \"A*29:02:01\"\n 7 eQD108     \"C*12:02:02\"\n 8 eTH332     \"\"          \n 9 eXL36      \"A*01:01\"   \n10 eLH54      \"C*07:02:01\"\n\n\nUse the View() function again, to look at the meta_data. Notice something? Some alleles are e.g. A*11:01, whereas others are B*51:01:02. You can find information on why, by visiting Nomenclature for Factors of the HLA System.\nLong story short, we only want to include Field 1 (allele group) and Field 2 (Specific HLA protein). You have prepared the stringr package for today. See if you can find a way to reduce e.g. B*51:01:02 to B*51:01 and then create a new variable Allele_F_1_2 accordingly, while also removing the ...x (where x is a number) subscripts from the Gene variable (It is an artifact from having the data in a wide format, where you cannot have two variables with the same name) and also, remove any NAs and \"\"s, denoting empty entries.\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nThere are several ways this can be achieved, the easiest being to consider if perhaps a part of the string based on indices could be of interest. This term “a part of a string” is called a substring, perhaps the stringr package contains a function work with substring? In the console, type stringr:: and hit tab. This will display the functions available in the stringr package. Scroll down and find the functionst starting with str_ and look for on, which might be relevant and remember you can use ?function_name to get more information on how a given function works.\n\n\n\n\n\nT19: Create the following data, according to specifications above:\n\n\nmeta_data |> \n  sample_n(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   Experiment Allele     Allele_F_1_2\n   <chr>      <chr>      <chr>       \n 1 eHO131     C*03:03:01 C*03:03     \n 2 eJL161     C*06:02:01 C*06:02     \n 3 eXL27      C*07:04    C*07:04     \n 4 ePD73      B*15:01    B*15:01     \n 5 eHO126     A*24:02:01 A*24:02     \n 6 eAV100     C*03:04:01 C*03:04     \n 7 eAM13      A*02:05:01 A*02:05     \n 8 eQD128     A*02:10    A*02:10     \n 9 eQD121     A*24:02:01 A*24:02     \n10 eQD111     B*08:01:01 B*08:01     \n\n\nThe asterisk, i.e. * is a rather annoying character because of ambiguity, so:\n\nT20: Clean the data a bit more, by removing the asterisk and redundant variables:\n\n\n\n\n\nmeta_data |> \n  sample_n(size = 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   Experiment Allele\n   <chr>      <chr> \n 1 eQD131     B51:01\n 2 eDH96      C03:03\n 3 eEE240     C06:02\n 4 eHO135     A03:01\n 5 eQD109     B07:02\n 6 eXL37      B44:03\n 7 eQD119     B08:01\n 8 eQD134     C04:03\n 9 eQD138     C06:02\n10 eXL32      C04:01\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint 1\n\n\nAgain, the stringr package may come in handy.

Finally, let us create a binding motif using the package ggseqlogo (More info here).\n\nT22: Subset the final peptide_meta_data data to A02:01 and unique observations of peptides of length 9 and re-create the below sequence logo\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nYou can pipe a vector of peptides into ggseqlogo, but perhaps you first need to pull that vector from the relevant variable in your tibble?

And/or perhaps ask your fellow group members if they know?\n\n\n\nCDR3b-sequences binding to pMHC\n\nT24: Subset the peptide_meta_data, such that the length of the CDR3b is 15, the allele is A02:01 and the peptide is LLFLVLIML and re-create the below sequence logo of the CDR3b sequences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ15: In your group, discuss what you see?\nT25: Play around with other combinations of k_CDR3b, Allele, and peptide and inspect how the logo changes\n\nDisclaimer: In this data set, we only get: A given CDR3b was found to recognise a given peptide in a given subject and that subject had a given haplotype - Something’s missing… Perhaps if you have had immunology, then you can spot it? There is a trick to get around this missing information, but that’s beyond scope of what we’re working with here."

Now we have a feeling for working with the lm() functions and a basic understanding of the meaning of the coefficients, when we are using linear regression to model a binary outcome. The reason that we use a linear regression model in this case is, that for these exercises, we want to investigate the relationship between variables rather than obtaining probability predictions, i.e.\n\nWhat genes are significantly up-/down-regulated between the patients with- and without early metastasis?\n\nSo, without further ado, let’s dive in!\n\n\nAll the Genes, all the models\nFirst, the recent couple of years have seen an immense development in unifying the modelling interface in R, which is notoriously inconsistent. You may be familiar with the caret package, the developer of which has created tidymodels, (which I really wish we had time to explore in details). In the following we will work with some of the principles for tidying model object using broom, having object nested in tibbles and working with these using purrr.\nNow, you saw above how we could fit one model for one gene. So, we could repeat the procedure you worked through for each gene, but first consider:\n\nQ11: How many genes are there in the gravier data set?\n\nNow, we just have to make one model for each gene!\n\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, let’s not! Also, recall: “We don’t loop, we func!”, so let’s see how that would work.\n\n\nModels, models everywhere…\nIn principle, you could overflow your environment with individual model objects, but that would require a lot of code-lines and a lot of hard-coding. But let us instead see if we can come up with something just a tad more clever.\n\nPreparing the Data\nFirst:\n\nQ12: Discuss in your group, if the gravier_clean_aug is a “wide” or a “long” dataset?\n\nOnce you have agreed upon and understood why, this is a wide data set, proceed and:\n\nT9: Create this long version of your gravier_clean_aug data and save it in gravier_clean_aug_long\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 488,040 × 3\n   early_metastasis gene   log2_expr_level\n              <dbl> <chr>            <dbl>\n 1                0 g2E09         -0.00144\n 2                0 g7F07         -0.00144\n 3                0 g1A01         -0.0831 \n 4                0 g3C09         -0.0475 \n 5                0 g3H08          0.0158 \n 6                0 g1A08         -0.0336 \n 7                0 g1B01         -0.136  \n 8                0 g1int1         0.0180 \n 9                0 g1E11          0.0257 \n10                0 g8G02          0.00720\n# ℹ 488,030 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nRecall which function took a dataset from “wide” to “long” format and also the three parameters of interest for that function is cols, names_to and values_to. If you look at my example, you will see that the columns we have pivoted have types <chr> and <dbl>, these will map to the names_to and values_to parameters respectively. The cols can be used with the so-called “helper-functions”, that we have previously talked about. If you look at the gene-columns in the data, all the genes starts with a “g”, so we can use the helper functions starts_with() and then give the argument “g” to the match parameter\n\nThe reason we want the “long” version of the data set is, that now we have ALL the genes defined in ONE gene column. This means that we can use group_by() to work per gene without looping (Recall: Don’t loop, only func!).\nNow:\n\nT10: Create a dplyr pipeline, use the group_by() function to group your gravier_clean_aug_long dataset by gene and then add the nest() and ungroup() functions to your pipeline\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 2,905 × 2\n   gene   data              \n   <chr>  <list>            \n 1 g2E09  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 2 g7F07  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 3 g1A01  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 4 g3C09  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 5 g3H08  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 6 g1A08  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 7 g1B01  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 8 g1int1 <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 9 g1E11  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n10 g8G02  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n# ℹ 2,895 more rows\n\n\nNote, this is conceptually a super-tricky data structure!\n\nQ13: Discuss in your group, what happened to the data?\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nTry to run each of the following code chunks and examine what happens at each step:\n\ngravier_clean_aug_long_nested\n\n\ngravier_clean_aug_long_nested |>\n  filter(gene == \"g2E09\") # Replace \"g2E09\" with whatever was YOUR favourite gene!\n\n\ngravier_clean_aug_long_nested |>\n  filter(gene == \"g2E09\") |> # Replace \"g2E09\" with whatever was YOUR favourite gene!\n  pull(data)\n\n\n\nQ14: Moreover, discuss in your group, what does <tibble [168 × 2]> mean?\n\nNow, if you’re experiencing, that the server seems slow, consider if you want to proceed now with ALL the genes or just a subset. If you just want a subset, then use sample_n() to randomly select e.g. 100 genes for further analysis. Remember you may want to use the set.seed() function to create a reproducible work flow even when sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting Models\nNow, recall our research question:\n\nWhat genes are significantly up-/down-regulated between the patients with- and without early metastasis?\n\nTo investigate this, we want to fit a linear model to each gene, i.e. as you did initially for your favourite gene, we want to do in a clever way per gene for ALL genes.\n\nT11: Use the group_by() function to let R know, that we want to work per gene\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 2,905 × 2\n# Groups:   gene [2,905]\n   gene   data              \n   <chr>  <list>            \n 1 g2E09  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 2 g7F07  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 3 g1A01  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 4 g3C09  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 5 g3H08  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 6 g1A08  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 7 g1B01  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 8 g1int1 <tibble [168 × 2]>\n 9 g1E11  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n10 g8G02  <tibble [168 × 2]>\n# ℹ 2,895 more rows\n\n\n\nT12: Then using the map()-function, add a new line to your pipeline, where you add a new variable model_object to your gravier_clean_aug_long_nested dataset, which R will compute per gene\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nTo do this you will need the following syntax and then wrap that inside the relevant tidyverse-function for creating a new variable:\n\nmodel_object = map(.x = data,\n                   .f = ~lm(formula = log2_expr_level ~ early_metastasis,\n                            data = .x))\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to understand the map() function here, it is completely central to functional programming with purrr:\n\nWe need the group_by() to define which variable holds the elements to each of which we want to map\nmodel_object is a new variable, we are creating, which will contain the result of our call to the map() function\n.x to what existing (nested) variable are we mapping?\n.f which function do we want to map to each element in the existing (nested) variable?\nNote that log2_expr_level and early_metastasis are variables “inside” the nested data variable\n\nNote, once again, this is conceptually a super-tricky data structure, not only do we have a per gene nested tibble, but now we also have a per gene nested model object - So please do make sure to discuss in your group, what is going on here, e.g. try running this and discuss what you see:\n\ngravier_clean_aug_long_nested |>\n  filter(gene == \"g2E09\") |> # Replace \"g2E09\" with whatever was YOUR favourite gene!\n  pull(model_object)\n\n\n\nTidying Models\nExcellent! Now we have a per gene model. Let us use the broom package to extract some information from each of the models. First, to get a better understanding of what is going on when calling the tidy() function, try running this:\n\ngravier_clean_aug_long_nested |>\n  \n  # Here, you should replace \"g2E09\" with whatever was YOUR favourite gene!\n  filter(gene == \"g2E09\") |> \n  \n  # Pull() on tibbles: This pulls out the model_object variable.\n  #   Note! This is a list, because we nested!\n  pull(model_object) |> \n  \n  # Pluck() on lists: From the list we got from the last step,\n  #   we \"pluck\" the first element\n  pluck(1) |>\n  \n  # The result of pluck, is a model object,\n  #   upon which we can call the tidy function\n  tidy(conf.int = TRUE,\n       conf.level = 0.95)\n\nNow, we want to apply this tidy() function per model_object:\n\nT13: Scroll a bit back to where we created the model_object and see if you can translate that into mapping the tidy() function to the model_object variable, thereby creating a new variable model_object_tidy - This is tricky, so do make sure to discuss in your group how this can be done!\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nRemember the parameters to the tidy() functions, which gives us the confidence intervals and defines corresponding level. Also, everything you need is in the previous layout of the map() function. Note, that the calls to the pull() and pluck() functions above, pertains to extracting from a tibble, which we do not want, on the contrary, we want all objects to be contained in our gravier_clean_aug_long_nested data\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 2,905 × 4\n# Groups:   gene [2,905]\n   gene   data               model_object model_object_tidy\n   <chr>  <list>             <list>       <list>           \n 1 g2E09  <tibble [168 × 2]> <lm>         <tibble [2 × 7]> \n 2 g7F07  <tibble [168 × 2]> <lm>         <tibble [2 × 7]> \n 3 g1A01  <tibble [168 × 2]> <lm>         <tibble [2 × 7]> \n 4 g3C09  <tibble [168 × 2]> <lm>         <tibble [2 × 7]> \n 5 g3H08  <tibble [168 × 2]> <lm>         <tibble [2 × 7]> \n 6 g1A08  <tibble [168 × 2]> <lm>         <tibble [2 × 7]> \n 7 g1B01  <tibble [168 × 2]> <lm>         <tibble [2 × 7]> \n 8 g1int1 <tibble [168 × 2]> <lm>         <tibble [2 × 7]> \n 9 g1E11  <tibble [168 × 2]> <lm>         <tibble [2 × 7]> \n10 g8G02  <tibble [168 × 2]> <lm>         <tibble [2 × 7]> \n# ℹ 2,895 more rows\n\n\nNote, once again, this is conceptually a super-tricky data structure, not only do we have a per gene nested tibble, but now we also have a per gene nested model object and now also a nested tibble of tidyed objects - So please again do make sure to discuss in your group, what is going on here, e.g. try running this and discuss what you see:\n\ngravier_clean_aug_long_nested |>\n  filter(gene == \"g2E09\") |> # Replace \"g2E09\" with whatever was YOUR favourite gene!\n  pull(model_object_tidy)\n\n\n\nWrangling\nWe’re almost there - just a bit of wrangling to go!\nJust as you saw that we could nest() on a variable (recall we did that for the gene variable), you can do the opposite and lo and behold, that is the unnest() function.

What are you on about??? For a nice primer on how multiple testing correction works, please read this article by Noble (2009)!\n\n\nRecap\nIf you (understandably by now) have lost a bit of overview of what is going on, let’s just re-iterate.\n\nWe have the gravier dataset, with the log2-expression levels for 2,905 genes of 168 patients of whom 111 did not have early metastasis and 57 who did\nWe are interested in investigating what genes are significantly up-/down-regulated between the patients with- and without early metastasis\nFirst, we retrieved the data from the data repository, cleaned and augmented it and saved it to disk\nThen pivoted the data, so we could work per gene (The gene variable)\nNext, we grouped per gene and nested the data (The data variable)\nThen, we fitted a linear model to each gene (The model_object variable)\nNext, we used the broom package to tidy the fitted model incl. getting confidence intervals (The model_object_tidy variable)\nLastly, we extracted the model parameters, corrected for multiple testing and added and indicator for significant findings\n\nNow, we actually have everything we need to answer:\n\nWhat genes are significantly up- or down-regulated between the patients with/without early metastasis?\n\nIn the following, we will use a level of significance of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) to provide this answer.\n\n\nVisualise\nRight, let’s get to it!\n\nT17: Re-create this forest plot to finally reveal the results of your analysis GROUP ASSIGNMENT (Important, see: how to)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nHere, you will have to use your indicator variable to identify significant genes before plotting and then it would probably be prudent to take a look at the fct_reorder() function and geom_errorbarh() representation\n\n\nT18: Re-create this volcano plot to finally reveal the results of your analysis GROUP ASSIGNMENT part II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nHere,before plotting you will have to create a new label-variable which takes value gene for significant genes and otherwise is simply an empty string, which we denote by \"\".

All bioinformatics departments in major players in Danish Pharma, are using git - Learning git is a key bio data science skill! Today, you will take your first steps - Happy Learning!\n\nT1: Find the GitHub repository for the ggplot2 R-package\nQ1: How many Contributors are there?\nT1: Find the GitHub repository for the Linux kernel\nQ2: How many Contributors are there?\nQ3: Discuss in your group why having an organised approach to version control is central? And consider the simple contrast of the challenges you were facing when doing the course assignments.\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nFirst, make sure to read and discuss the feedback you got from last week’s assignment!\nThe following exercises have to be done in your groups! You must move at the same pace and progress together as a team through the exercises!\nBe aware of which editor you are using in RStudio! You must work in the “Visual” editor instead of the “Source” editor. ALL OF YOU! If one of you works in a different editor, it could cause a conflict issue!\nGitHub is the place for collaborative coding and different group members will have to do different tasks in a specific order, to make it through the exercises together, so… Team Up and don’t rush it!\nFirst, select a team Captain, that person will have to carry out specific tasks. If Team is stated, then that refers to all group members and lastly if Crew is stated, then that is everyone but the Captain. Please note, that tasks are sequential, so if a task is assigned to the Captain, then the Crew has to await completion before proceeding!\n\nTeam\n\nGo to GitHub and login\nIn the upper right corner, click on your profile picture. Then in the menu, click on “Your Organizations” and go into rforbiodatascienceYY (replace YY with year). If you are not a member, contact a TA NOW before proceeding. Next, go into repositories (top left).\n\n\n\nCaptain\n\nClick “New repository”\nSince you created the project from the organisation, the default owner of the repository is the organisation (rforbiodatascienceYY). Verify and keep that, please.\nName the repository groupXX, where XX is your group number, e.g. 02\nSelect Public\nTick Add a README file\nClick Create repository\nClick Settings in the menu line starting with <> Code\nUnder Access, click Collaborators and teams\nClick Add people\nWrite a group members username and select the role “Maintain”.\nClick the correct suggestion\nSelect Add username to this repository\nRepeat for all group members\n\n\n\nCrew\n\nRefresh the page and go into the new repository. If you don’t see it, check your mail and accept your invitation to join the repository.\n\n\n\nTeam\n\nClick here to go to the course RStudio cloud server and login\nIn the upper right corner, where it should say r_for_bio_data_science, click\nChoose  New Project...\nSelect  Version Control\nSelect  Git\nUnder Repository URL:, enter https://github.com/rforbiodatascienceYY/groupXX, where again you replace YY with year and replace XX with your group number, e.g. 02.\nUnder Project directory name:, enter lab07_git_exercises\nUnder Create project as a subdirectory of:, make sure that is says ~/projects\nClick Create Project\n\nCongratulations! You have just cloned your first GitHub repository!\nIn your Files pane, you should now see:\n\n\n\n\n\n…and now in your Environment pane, you should see a new git tab:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you click the git tab, you should see:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up your Credentials and Personal Access Token (Team)\nGitHub doesn’t know who you are, you’re just someone who cloned your first GitHub repository and now you want to do all sorts of stuff! We can’t have that, so let’s fix that GitHub doesn’t know who you are!\n\nIn the Console, run the command:\n\n\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME\", user.email = \"THE_EMAIL_YOU_USED_TO_CREATE_YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT\")\n\n\nIn the Console, run the command:\n\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\n\nLogin\nUnder Note, where it says DESCRIBE THE TOKEN'S USE CASE, delete the text and write e.g.R for Bio Data Science lab 7 git exercises\nUnder Expiration, where it says 30 days, change that to 90 days\nDo not change any other setting, but simply scroll down and click Generate token\nA new Personal access tokens (classic) page will appear, stating your personal access token, which starts with ghp_, go ahead and copy it\nStore the PAT somewhere save, e.g. in a password management tool. It will serve as your password when connecting to the repository via R.\nAgain in the console, run the below command and enter your PAT when prompted for the password:\n\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nStop, wait a minute and make sure, that ALL group members are at this stage of the exercises.\n\n\nMaking your Credentials and Personal Access Token stick around (Team)\nThe thing is, we’re actually working on a Linux server here, this entails a that you’re credentials and PAT exists in a cache, which is cleared every 15 minutes. This. Is. Annoying! So let’s fix it!\nFirst of all RStudio is a (G)raphical (U)ser (I)nterface, meaning, that it allows you to do pointy-clicky stuff, but at the end of the day, everything happens at the command line. That also goes for git, so your button-pushing simply gets converted into commands, which are executed at the command line. If you are not comfortable with the command line, don’t worry, the pointy-clicky stuff will be sufficient for now! If you are comfortable with the command line, I advice to get comfortable with git on the command line as well, you do get some extra bang-for-the-buck!\nNow, a brief visit of the command line:\n\nIn the Console pane, click the Terminal tab, which gains you access to the system underlying RStudio\nYou should see something like user@pupilX:/net/pupilX/home/people/user/projects/lab07_git_exercises$\nEnter ls -a, this will list all the files, compare with your Files pane, you will see that RStudio is “hiding” something from you, namely the .git folder\nEnter ls -a .git and you will see the content of the folder, this is where all the git-magic happens\nSee the config file? That holds the configuration, enter git config --global --list\nRecall you entered your GitHub username and mail? This is where it ended up! Note the credential.helper=cache, which tells us, that the credentials are being cached. Now, enter git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=86400'. Hint: You can paste with Ctrl-Shift-V in the terminal on Windows.\nRe-run the command git config --global --list and confirm the change\nGo back to your Console and run the command gitcreds::gitcreds_set(). Select option 2, and re-enter your PAT.\nIf you didn’t get a list of options in the prior step, restart your R session and retry.\n\nCongratulations! You have now used the command line and you will forever be part of an elite few, who know that everything you see in hacker-movies is BS, except perhaps for Wargames and Mr. Robot! Also, your PAT will now be good for 24h\n\n\n\nYour first collaboration\n\nTeam\n\nCreate a new Quarto document, title it student_id and save id as student_id.qmd, where student_id is your… You guessed it! Make sure that “Use visual markdown editor” is checked.\nIn the environment pane, click the git tab\nTick the 3 boxes under staged\nClick commit\nIn the upper right corner, add a Commit message, e.g “First commit by student_id”\nClick the Commit button\nA pop-up, will give you details on your commit, look through them and then click Close\nNow, very important ALWAYS click the  Pull button BEFORE clicking the  Push button\nClicking Pull, you should see “Already up to date.”\nThen click Push\n\n\nQ4: Discuss in your group what each of the steps did and why they are performed?\n\n\n\n\nYour next collaboration\nThat first collaboration was easy right!? Well, you were all working on different files…\n\nCaptain\n\nCreate a new Quarto Document, title it “Group Document” and save it as group_document.qmd\nUsing markdown headers, create one section for each group member, incl. yourself. Here, you can use your names, student ids or whatever you deem appropriate\nAgain in the Environment pane, make sure you are in the git tab and then tick the box next to group_document.qmd. If you do not see the document in this window after saving, refresh the browser and it should appear.\nClick Commit\nAdd a commit message, e.g. “Add group document”\nClick the Commit button\nClick Pull (You should be “Already up to date.”)\nClick Push\nClick Close\nAgain, go to the group GitHub and confirm that you see the new document you just created\n\n\n\nTeam\n\nClick Pull and confirm that you now also have the file group_document.qmd\nOpen group_document.qmd and find your assigned section\nIn your section and your section only, enter some text, add a few code chunks with some R-code\nMake sure to save the document\nNow again, find the group_document.qmd in the git tab of the Environment pane and tick the box under Staged\nClick Commit\nNote how your changes to the document are highlighted in green\nAdd a commit message, e.g. “Update the STUDENT_ID section” and click Commit\nClick Close\nClick Pull\nClick Push\nGo to the group GitHub, find the group_document.qmd and click it, do you see your changes?\n\nOnce everyone has added to their assigned section, everyone should do a pull/push, so everyone has the complete version of the group_document.qmd.\n\n\n\nYour first branching\nOk that’s pretty great so far - Right? The thing is… Consider, the ggplot2 repository, that you found in T1. Thousands of companies and even more thousands of people rely on ggplot for advanced data visualisation. What would happen, if you wanted to add a new feature or wanted to optimise an existing one, while people were actively installing your package? They would get what stage your code was in, which may or may not be functional - Enter branching!\nBelow here, is an illustration, consider the Master the stable version people can download and use and then Your Work will be the feature or update that you personally are working on. Someone Else’s Work will be another team and that persons work on a new feature or update. Before the last green circle, note how both the Your Work- and Someone Else’s Work-branches are merged onto the Master-branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere can be even more branches\n\nQ5: Again, find the ggplot GitHub site and see if you can find how many branches there are?\n\n\nTeam\n\nGo to your RStudio session and in the git tab of the Environment pane, click  New Branch\nIn branch name, enter your student id\nYou should see a pop-up Branch 'STUDENT_ID' set up to track remote branch 'STUDENT_ID' from 'origin'., go ahead and click Close\nNext to where you clicked New Branch just before, it should now say STUDENT_ID, click it and confirm that you see STUDENT_ID and Main\nLook at the illustration above and make sure you are on par with that from the original branch main, which is equivalent with Master, you have created a new branch STUDENT_ID, which is equivalent to Your Work\nClick STUDENT_ID and you will get a confirmation that you are already on that branch and that you are up-to-date, click Close\nIn the group_document.qmd under your section, using markdown, enter a new sub-header and name it e.g. New feature or New analysis. Make sure that you all use the “Visual” editor for the .qmd file!\nEnter some text, a few code chunks with a bit of R-code of your choosing and save the document\nAgain, in the git tab, tick the box under staged and click Commit\nAdd a commit message, e.g. New feature from STUDENT_ID and click Commit\nClick Close, Pull, Close, Push and Close and then close the commit window\nGo to your group GitHub and confirm that you now have at least 2 branches\nMake sure you are in the main branch and then click the group_document.qmd, you should now not see your new feature/analysis that you added\nOn the left, where it says main, click and select your STUDENT_ID, you should now see your new feature/analysis that you added\n\nCongratulations! You have now succesfully done your first branching!\n\n\n\nYour first branch merging\n\nTeam\n\nGo to your groups GitHub page, at the top it should say STUDENT_ID had recent pushes..., click the Compare & pull request\nYour commit message will appear and where it says Leave a comment, add a comment like e.g. I'm done, all seems to be working now! or similar\nClick Create pull request\nIt should now say This branch have no conflicts with the base branch, confirm and click Merge pull request\nClick Confirm merge after which it should now say Pull request successfully merged and closed\nYou have now fully merged, so go ahead and click Delete branch\nRevisit the previous illustration and compare with your branch workflow, make sure that everyone in the groups are on par here\nFinally return to your RStudio session and make sure you switch to the main branch\n\nCongratulations! You have now successfully done your first branch merge!\nBut wait, what was this Pull request??? What you actually did, was: 1. Created a new branch 1. Completed a new feature/analysis 1. Push’ed the new feature/analysis to GitHub 1. Created a Pull request for merging your branch STUDENT_ID into the main branch 1. Approved and completed the Pull request\nThink about e.g. again the ggplot2 repo, if anyone could create a new branch and then do as described above, then there would be no way of making quality control. Therefore, typically such pull requests will have to be approved by someone. This can either be someone who is close-to-the-code e.g. in the case of ggplot2, that’d be someone like Hadley. In a company, then that might be some senior developer approving junior developers pull requests. At one point you might have seen something like “The main branch is unprotected”, this is exactly that!\n\n\n\nYour first merge conflict\nOkay, that’s all good an well. Seems easy and straight forward, right? Well, that is as long as we don’t have a conflict. A conflict is when two or more changes to one file are not compatible, consider:\nTop 10 Bio Data Science Languages of ALL Time:\n10. It is \n9. Impossible\n8. to rank them\n7. Because\n6. programming is subjective\n5. and everyone\n4. has\n3. different\n2. tastes\n1. R\nIn fact, let’s screw things up!\n\nCaptain\n\nGo to the RStudio session and where you usually click Quarto Document..., this time let’s just create a simple Text File\nCopy/paste the Top 10 Bio Data Science Languages of ALL Time into the file\nSave the file as best_ds_langs.txt\nMake sure you are in the main branch\nDo a commit/pull/push and check the file ended at your group github\n\n\n\nCrew\nRrrrrrr… Let’s commit mutiny! (Double pun intended)\n\nMake sure you are in the main branch and then hit Pull\nOpen the best_ds_langs.txt\nEach of you separately (wrongfully) replace R with an (inferior) bio data science language of your choice (you can really write anything)\nNow, this time we do not pull first, simply commit and then push\nNow you can pull\nYou will now get notified about a merge conflict\nClose and re-open the best_ds_langs.txt file, it should look something like:\n\nTop 10 Bio Data Science Languages of ALL Time:\n10. It is \n9. Impossible\n8. to rank them\n7. Because\n6. programming is subjective\n5. and everyone\n4. has\n3. different\n2. tastes\n<<<<<<< HEAD\n1. C++\n=======\n1. Python\n>>>>>>> 85283ca3246b7f7462ab633085f92ac5f173d3e7\n\n\nCaptain\nGet your Crew in order!\n\nSimply edit the file so that you delete everything below 2. and add the final line, which emphasises that 1. R is superior!\nThe box under Staged looks a bit odd right, just click it\nClick Commit and add a commit message, e.g. Fixed merge conflict, got crew back in order!\nClick Commit, Close, Pull, Close, Push, Close and close the commit window\nReturn to your GitHub group and confirm all is in order and you can continue with confidence knowing that R is superior! (Check the file to make sure)\n\nCongratulations! You have now fixed your first merge conflict!\nLastly, click the History button next to the Push button and explore the history of how your branches and commits have changed through these exercises.\n\n\n\nThe .gitignore file\nYou may have noticed the .gitignore file?\n\nOne crew member\n\nGo to your RStudio session, find the .gitignore file and click it\n\nIt contains a list of files and folders, which should not end up at your git repo, i.e. files which should be ignored. An important aspect of working with GitHub is that GitHub is meant for code, not data! Let’s say we had a data and a data/_raw/, we could add those to the .gitignore file to avoid the data being included in our commits. Currently, files like .RData and folders like .Rproj.user should be listed in the .gitignore file, as these are unique to each of your own sessions and shouldn’t be committed to the repo.\n\nUpdate the .gitignore file and get the updated version to GitHub\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nYou have not gotten to play around with collaborative coding using git - Well done!\nIf you are more curious for more, please feel free to play around with a new file, edit commit/pull/push etc. Perhaps also take an extra look at the GitHub, explore and learn more 👍\n\n\nGROUP ASSIGNMENT (Important, see: how to)\nFirst of all, here we have just scratched the surface. You can read much more here.\nYour assignment this time, will be to:\n\nGo to this post on “PCA tidyverse style” by Claus O. Wilke, Professor of Integrative Biology\nAgain, create a reproducible micro-report together, this time, where you do a code-along with either the data in the post, the gravier data, and/or any other dataset.\nUse your GitHub group repository to collaborate - you should all contribute. Again, make sure that you are using the “Visual” editor while working on this!\nYour hand in will be a link to your micro-report in your GitHub group repository\nNote, focus here is on the git learning objectives and doing a code-along, which is not a copy/paste of the code, but using it as inspiration to create your own nice concise tidy micro-report!\nMake sure to check the Assignment Guidelines\nAnd also follow the Course Code Styling\nHOW TO HAND IN: Go to http://github.com/rforbiodatascienceYY/groupXX, replace YY with year and groupXX with appropriate group number, then copy the link and paste it into an empty text (.txt) file. Hand in this text file. No need to zip your html file, since we are accessing it through the repository!"

    "text": "Exercises\nRead the steps of this exercises carefully while completing them\n\nIntroduction\nFirst, make sure to read and discuss the feedback you got from last week’s assignment!\nThe aim of these exercises is to set up a collaborative coding project using GitHub and collaborate on creating a simple R package that replicates the central dogma of molecular biology.\nThe exercises will build upon what you learned in Lab 7 and its exercises. But don’t worry too much, the setup steps will be given here as well.\n\n\n\nTASKS\nIf you haven’t read the Primer on R packages yet, consider reading it now.\n\n\nTask 1 - Setting up the R package\nIn the first task, one team member (you decide who) will initiate a package project and push it to Github. Then, when instructed, the remaining group members will connect to that repository, and the real package building will begin.\n\nTask 1.1 - Create R Package\n\nGo to R for Bio Data Science RStudio Server and login.\nClick Create a project in the top left and choose New Directory.\nSelect R Package and pick a fitting Package name.\n\nThe package you will create will replicate the central dogma of molecular biology. Let that inspire you\nLook up naming rules here\nThe most important rule: _, -, and ' are not allowed.\n\nTick the “Create git repository” box.\nClick “Create project”.\n\nRStudio will now create an R project for you that contains all necessary files and folders.\n\nOpen the DESCRIPTION file and write a title for your package, a small description, and add authors.\n\n\nWhen adding authors, the format is:\n\n\nAuthors@R:\n  c(person(given = \"firstname\",\n           family = \"lastname\",\n           role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"), # There must be a \"cre\", but there can only be one\n           email = \"your@email.com\"), \n    person(given = \"firstname\",\n           family = \"lastname\",\n           role = \"aut\",\n           email = \"your@email.com\"))\n\n\nCreate an MIT license (from the console) usethis::use_mit_license(\"Group name\")\nIf you didn’t tick the “Create git repository”: Run usethis::use_git(). If the “Git” tab is not in the lower left panel: reopen the R project.\n\n\nOptional setup steps (generally good, but not essential for this course)\n\n\n\nAdd a Readme file usethis::use_readme_rmd( open = FALSE ). You will do that in the Group Assignment later\n\n\nAdd a lifecycle badge: usethis::use_lifecycle_badge( \"Experimental\" )\n\n\nWrite vignettes: usethis::use_vignette(\"Vignette name\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 1.2 - Setup GitHub Repository for your group’s R package\nDuring the previous class, you have been using a combination of console and terminal to set up GitHub. This week, you will solely be using the console.\nStill only the first team member\n\nGo to https://github.com/rforbiodatascience24 and go to repositories.\nClick the green New button\nCreate a new repository called group_X_package. Remember to replace the X\nSelect rforbiodatascience24 as owner\nMake the repository Public\nClick the green Create repository button\nIn this new repository, click the settings tab\nClick Collaborators and Team\nClick the green Add people button\nInvite the remaining group members\nAll other team members should now have access to the repository, but do not create your own project yet.\n\n\n\nTask 1.3 - Connect your RStudio Server Project to the GitHub Repository\nStill only the first team member\n\nFind your PAT key or create a new\n\n\nHow to create a new one\n\n\n\nType in the console usethis::create_github_token(). You’re going to be redirected to GitHub website.\n\nIn case you did that step manually, remember to give permission to access your repositories.\n\nYou need to type your password. Don’t change the default settings of creating the token except for the description – set ‘RStudio Server’ or something similar. Then hit Generate token.\n\nCopy the generated token (should start with ghp_) and store it securely (e.g., in a password manager). Do not keep it in a plain file.\n\n\nGo back to the RStudio Server project\nType in the console gitcreds::gitcreds_set() and paste the PAT key\nStage all files (in the git window in the top right) by ticking all boxes under Staged\nStill in the console, run the following commands. Replace your group number and use your GitHub username and email. You run these to link your project to the GitHub repository you created. Remember to replace the X.\n\n\nusethis::use_git_remote(name = \"origin\", \"https://github.com/rforbiodatascience24/group_X_package.git\", overwrite = TRUE) # Remember to replace the X\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"USERNAME\", user.email = \"USEREMAIL@EXAMPLE.ORG\")\ngert::git_commit_all(\"Package setup\")\ngert::git_push(\"origin\")\n\nAll other team members\nAfter your teammate has pushed to GitHub.\n\nIn the RStudio Server, create a new project based on the GitHub Repository just created by your teammate.\n\nClick Create a project in the top left.\nChoose Version Control and then Git.\nPaste in the repository URL: https://github.com/rforbiodatascience24/group_X_package.git. Remember to replace the X.\nGive the directory a fitting name and click Create Project.\n\nFind your PAT key or create a new\n\n\nHow to create a new one\n\n\n\nType in the console usethis::create_github_token(). You’re going to be redirected to GitHub website.\n\nIn case you did it manually, remember to give permission to access your repositories.\n\nYou need to type your password. Don’t change the default settings of creating the token except for the description – set ‘RStudio Server’ or something similar. Then hit Generate token.\n\nCopy the generated token (should start with ghp_) and store it securely (e.g. in password manager). Do not keep it in a plain file.\n\n\nGo back to the RStudio Server project\nType in the console gitcreds::gitcreds_set() and paste the PAT key\nStill in the console, run the following commands. Replace your GitHub username and email.\n\n\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"USERNAME\", user.email = \"USEREMAIL@EXAMPLE.ORG\")\n\nIf RStudio at any point asks you to log in to GitHub, redo step 4 and 5.\nNow you are ready to work on the R package.\n\n\n\nTask 2 - Build the package\n\nEach team member should build and implement their own function. The code will be given, but you will be asked to come up with a name for your function and many of the variables, so discuss in the team what naming convention you want to use. Do you want to use snake_case (common in tidyverse) or camelCase (common in Bioconductor)? It doesn’t really matter, but be consistent.\n\n\nTask 2.1 - Incorporate data\nIn this task you will include the following codon table in your package.\nThis task should be done by one team member. The rest should follow along.\n\nBelow is a standard codon table. In the console, store the table in an R object with a name of your own choosing.\n\n\nc(\"UUU\" = \"F\", \"UCU\" = \"S\", \"UAU\" = \"Y\", \"UGU\" = \"C\",\n  \"UUC\" = \"F\", \"UCC\" = \"S\", \"UAC\" = \"Y\", \"UGC\" = \"C\",\n  \"UUA\" = \"L\", \"UCA\" = \"S\", \"UAA\" = \"_\", \"UGA\" = \"_\",\n  \"UUG\" = \"L\", \"UCG\" = \"S\", \"UAG\" = \"_\", \"UGG\" = \"W\",\n  \"CUU\" = \"L\", \"CCU\" = \"P\", \"CAU\" = \"H\", \"CGU\" = \"R\",\n  \"CUC\" = \"L\", \"CCC\" = \"P\", \"CAC\" = \"H\", \"CGC\" = \"R\",\n  \"CUA\" = \"L\", \"CCA\" = \"P\", \"CAA\" = \"Q\", \"CGA\" = \"R\",\n  \"CUG\" = \"L\", \"CCG\" = \"P\", \"CAG\" = \"Q\", \"CGG\" = \"R\",\n  \"AUU\" = \"I\", \"ACU\" = \"T\", \"AAU\" = \"N\", \"AGU\" = \"S\",\n  \"AUC\" = \"I\", \"ACC\" = \"T\", \"AAC\" = \"N\", \"AGC\" = \"S\",\n  \"AUA\" = \"I\", \"ACA\" = \"T\", \"AAA\" = \"K\", \"AGA\" = \"R\",\n  \"AUG\" = \"M\", \"ACG\" = \"T\", \"AAG\" = \"K\", \"AGG\" = \"R\",\n  \"GUU\" = \"V\", \"GCU\" = \"A\", \"GAU\" = \"D\", \"GGU\" = \"G\",\n  \"GUC\" = \"V\", \"GCC\" = \"A\", \"GAC\" = \"D\", \"GGC\" = \"G\",\n  \"GUA\" = \"V\", \"GCA\" = \"A\", \"GAA\" = \"E\", \"GGA\" = \"G\",\n  \"GUG\" = \"V\", \"GCG\" = \"A\", \"GAG\" = \"E\", \"GGG\" = \"G\")\n\n\nRun usethis::use_data(NAME_OF_YOUR_OBJECT, overwrite = TRUE, internal = TRUE)\nYou have now made the data available to our functions, but we also want to make it visible for our users.\n\nRun usethis::use_data(NAME_OF_YOUR_OBJECT, overwrite = TRUE).\n\nWrite a data manual (document the data).\n\nAll non-internal data should be documented in a data.R file in the R folder. Create it with usethis::use_r(\"data\")\nAdd the following scaffold to R/data.R and write a very brief description of the data (see an example here). Don’t spend a lot of time here.\n\n\n\n#' Title\n#' \n#' Description\n#' \n#' \n#' @source \\url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi?chapter=tgencodes#SG1}\n\"NAME_OF_YOUR_OBJECT\"\n\nNormally, you should also describe how the raw data was cleaned. You would do that in the file that opens after running usethis::use_data_raw( name = \"NAME_OF_YOUR_OBJECT\", open = TRUE ), but that is less relevant here, so we will skip that part.\nYour package now includes some data.\nRestart R, clean your Environment (small broom in the Environment tab), run the three lines of code from The Package Workflow section:\n\nrstudioapi::documentSaveAll()  # Saves all you files\ndevtools::document()  # Writes all your manuals for you\ndevtools::load_all()  # Simulates library(\"your package\"), allowing you to use your functions\n\nAnd run ?NAME_OF_YOUR_OBJECT. OBS For some unknown reason, this does not work on the current R version (4.3.1). Instead, you can click the “Build” tab next to the “Git” tab and then “install”. After installing and attaching, your manual should pop up. Try printing the object as well to see what it looks like print(NAME_OF_YOUR_OBJECT).\nPush your changes to GitHub. The other team members pull the changes to have the data available to you as well.\n\n\n\nTask 2.2 - Implement functions\nIn this task you will be working individually to implement a function each. If you are fewer in the team than the number of functions. The quickest to finish can implement the remaining, or separate them out as you see fit.\nIf you want an additional challenge, each team member can create their own Git branch gert::git_branch_checkout(\"NAME_OF_BRANCH\") and work there. When done, merge your branch with the main branch. That is a more clean and ‘proper’ workflow, but completely optional.\nIf you are in doubt what the underlying functions do, run ?function_name to get a hint about their purpose. OBS For some unknown reason, this does not work on the current R version (4.3.1). As mentioned with the data, you can install your package, and then load the manual. Also, remember the functions are replicating the central dogma. Let that inspire you, when naming the functions and variables. If you get stuck, ask your teammates about their functions.\nFunction five is a bit more involved. Do it together or help your teammate out if it causes problems.\nFor each function (found below), complete the following steps:\n\nLook carefully at your function. Choose a fitting name for it\nRun usethis::use_r(\"function_name\") to create an .R file for the function\nPaste in the function and rename all places it says name_me with fitting names\nClick somewhere in the function. In the toolbar at the very top of the page, choose Code and click Insert Roxygen Skeleton\nFill out the function documentation\n\nGive the function a title\nDo not write anything after @export\nThe parameters should have the format: @param param_name description of parameter\nThe return has the format: @return description of function output\nExamples can span multiple lines and what you write will be run, so make it runnable.\nImportant! Either fill out everything or delete what you don’t. Otherwise, the package check will fail (Do not delete @export for these functions).\n\nRun the three lines of codes from The Package Workflow section\n\n\nIf at this point, you get a warning that NAMESPACE already exists, delete it and try again.\n\n\nrstudioapi::documentSaveAll()  # Saves all you files\ndevtools::document()  # Writes all your manuals for you\ndevtools::load_all()  # Simulates library(\"your package\"), allowing you to use your functions\n\n\nView your function documentation with ?function_name\nDefining a test or a series of tests around your newly created function ensures future corrections will not yield undesired results. Create such a test for your function. Run usethis::use_test(\"function_name\") and write a test. Draw some inspiration from here or from running ?testthat::expect_equal.\n\nSkip this step for function five. Instead, write inline code comments for each chunk of code. Press Cmd+Shift+c / Ctrl+Shift+C to comment your currently selected line.\n\nRerun the three lines from The Package Workflow section and check that the package works with devtools::check()\n\n\n\nBriefly about check\n\ndevtools::check() will check every aspect of your package and run the tests you created. You will likely get some warnings or notes like ‘No visible binding for global variables’. They are often harmless, but, if you like, you can get rid of them as described here. The check will tell you what might cause problems with your package and often also how to fix it. If there are any errors, fix those. Warnings and notes are also good to address. Feel free to do that if any pops up.\n\n\nIf it succeeds without errors, push your changes to GitHub\n\nIf you decided to create branches review last week’s exercises for guidance\nAlways pull before pushing\nUse the RStudio GUI if you prefer\nRemember to pull first\nIf you chose to create your own branch, merge it with master/main.\n\n\n\n\nFunction one\n\n\nname_me1 <- function(name_me2){\n  name_me3 <- sample(c(\"A\", \"T\", \"G\", \"C\"), size = name_me2, replace = TRUE)\n  name_me4 <- paste0(name_me3, collapse = \"\")\n  return(name_me4)\n}\n\n\n\n\nFunction two\n\n\nname_me1 <- function(name_me2){\n  name_me3 <- gsub(\"T\", \"U\", name_me2)\n  return(name_me3)\n}\n\n\n\n\nFunction three\n\n\nname_me1 <- function(name_me2, start = 1){\n  name_me3 <- nchar(name_me2)\n  codons <- substring(name_me2,\n                      first = seq(from = start, to = name_me3-3+1, by = 3),\n                      last = seq(from = 3+start-1, to = name_me3, by = 3))\n  return(codons)\n}\n\n\n\n\nFunction four\n\nNAME_OF_YOUR_OBJECT refers to the codon table you stored in Task 2.\n\nname_me <- function(codons){\n  name_me2 <- paste0(NAME_OF_YOUR_OBJECT[codons], collapse = \"\")\n  return(name_me2)\n}\n\n\n\n\nFunction five\n\nThis function will be the first to use dependencies. As a reminder, a dependency is a package that your package depends on. In this case, it will be stringr and ggplot2. They are already installed, so you don’t need to do that. The best way to add these packages to your own is to first add them to your package dependencies with usethis::use_package(\"package_name\"). If you care about reproducibility, you can add min_version = TRUE to the function call to specify a required minimum package version of the dependency. Run usethis::use_package for both dependencies.\nFor the ggplot2 functions, we will use ggplot2::function_name everywhere a ggplot2 function is used. Also add @import ggplot2 to the function description (this is often done with ggplot2 because it has a lot of useful plotting functions with only rare name overlaps). If you want to be more precise, add @importFrom ggplot2 ggplot aes geom_col theme_bw theme instead. The same applies for stringr, but since we only use a few functions, add @importFrom stringr str_split boundary str_count to the function description.\n\nname_me1 <- function(name_me2){\n  name_me3 <- name_me2 |>  \n    stringr::str_split(pattern = stringr::boundary(\"character\"), simplify = TRUE) |>\n    as.character() |> \n    unique()\n  \n  counts <- sapply(name_me3, function(amino_acid) stringr::str_count(string = name_me2, pattern =  amino_acid)) |>  \n    as.data.frame()\n  \n  colnames(counts) <- c(\"Counts\")\n  counts[[\"Name_me2\"]] <- rownames(counts)\n  \n  name_me4 <- counts |>  \n    ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = Name_me2, y = Counts, fill = Name_me2)) +\n    ggplot2::geom_col() +\n    ggplot2::theme_bw() +\n    ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n  \n  return(name_me4)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3 - Group discussion\n\nDescribe each function to each other in order - both what it does and which names you gave them and their variables.\nThe person(s) responsible for function five, describe how you added the two packages as dependencies.\nDiscuss why it is a good idea to limit the number of dependencies your package has. When can’t it always be avoided?\nDiscuss the difference between adding an @importFrom package function tag to a function description compared to using package::function(). Read this section if you are not sure or just want to learn more."

The vignette should include a brief description of what the package is about and demonstrate how each function in the package is used (individually and in conjunction with each other). As a final section, discuss use cases for the package and what other functions could be included. Also include the main points from your discussion in Task 3.\nInclude a link to your group’s GitHub repository at the top of the vignette. Hand it in as a pdf in DTU Learn.\n\nCreate a vignette with usethis::use_vignette(\"your_package_name\").\nWhen you are done writing it, run devtools::build_vignettes().\nAt the top line of your vignette, change rmarkdown::html_vignette to rmarkdown::pdf_document\nRerun devtools::build_vignettes() - the created pdf-file in the doc folder is the document to hand it.\nLastly, duplicate the vignette as the GitHub README\n\nCreate a README with usethis::use_readme_rmd( open = TRUE ).\nCopy the content of the vignette Rmarkdown into the readme Keep the top part of the README as is.

However, I personally also use it to quickly get going with packages.\nWhen starting out with an R package, it may seem complicated with a lot of things to remember. golem remembers these things for you. When setting up your package / Shiny app with golem::create_golem(\"Name of your awesome package/app\"), it creates a dev folder with a few files listing all you need to get started with an R package.\nIt does also give you a lot of other things that you will rarely use, and it also sets up some basic structures for Shiny apps. These can simply be deleted if you are not also building a Shiny app (which you will next week)."

Setting it up is quite easy:\n\nGo to posit Cloud\nClick the blue GET STARTED button\nUnder Cloud Free, click the blue Learn more button\nClick the long blue Sign Up button\nEnter your information for setting up an account\nMake sure to Verify Your Email as instructed\nThen return to where you set up the account and click the blue Continue button\n\nCongratulations! You have now created your personal posic cloud account. You will land in Your Workspace. Here you will have to create a new project, which you will use to work on the exercises today, so please:\n\nIn the upper right corner, click the blue New Project button\nChoose New RStudio Project\nYour project will be prepared and then deployed and you will land in the familiar RStudio IDE. Next to Your Workspace in the upper left corner, click where it says Untitled Project and name your project, e.g. R4BDS Shiny Exercises\n\nNow, let us do some quick setup:\n\nClick Tools and then Global Options...\nUnder Workspace, untick Restore .RData into workspace on startup\nNext to Save workspace to .RData on exit:, choose Never\nIn the lower right corner, click Apply\nNow on the left, find and click Pane Layout and click Environment, History, Conne and choose Console\nIn the lower right corner, click Apply\n\nOptionally you can adjust the visual appearance:\n\nNow on the left, find and click Appearance\nUnder Editor theme:, click a few options and see if you can find something you like\nIf you want to return to the default, simply find and click Textmate (default)\n\nOptionally, you can add a third column enabling you to e.g. have two Quarto Documents / Scripts / Text files open simultaneously:\n\nOn the left, find and click Pane Layout\nClick Add Column\nNote, this is best suited for wide desktop screens, so if you change your mind, simply click Remove Column\n\nOnce you are done, click OK to close the Options\n\n\nInitial “Hello Shiny World”\nNow let us get started on Shiny. First, find the console and enter:\n\nlibrary(\"shiny\")\n\nYou are going to get an error message, make sure to read it, so you can fix it.\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nR does not know what you are asking for here. You are missing “something”, how can we install “something” we are missing? Note, here on the posit cloud you are allowed to install tools you need\n\nOnce you have fixed the error, in the console, run:\n\nlibrary(\"shiny\")\nrunExample(\"01_hello\")\n\nYou may get a Popup Blocked message, if so, simply click Try Again. The you should see:\n\nNow, this is the frontend of a real life Shiny app. You can try to alter the Number of bins: and see what happens.\nThere are a multitude of such built in examples.\n\nTask: Try to play around with a few of the following to get an initial feel for what you can do with Shiny and discuss what you see in your group:\n\n\nrunExample(\"01_hello\")      # a histogram\nrunExample(\"02_text\")       # tables and data frames\nrunExample(\"03_reactivity\") # a reactive expression\nrunExample(\"04_mpg\")        # global variables\nrunExample(\"05_sliders\")    # slider bars\nrunExample(\"06_tabsets\")    # tabbed panels\nrunExample(\"07_widgets\")    # help text and submit buttons\nrunExample(\"08_html\")       # Shiny app built from HTML\nrunExample(\"09_upload\")     # file upload wizard\nrunExample(\"10_download\")   # file download wizard\nrunExample(\"11_timer\")      # an automated timer\n\n\n\nYour First Shiny App\nNow, let us build the 01_hello-app from scratch!\n\nGo to your Posit Cloud session and click File \\(\\rightarrow\\) New File \\(\\rightarrow\\) R Script\nNow, click File \\(\\rightarrow\\) Save\nName the file 01_hello.R\nCopy/paste the code below here into the empty file and again remember to save\nThen at the menu just above your open file, click Run App\nCheck if it works and compare with the 01_hello-example\n\nImportant: This is an R-script file NOT a Quarto document! Think of it as if you take all the code boxes and only include those in your file.\n\n\n\nCode for your first app\n\n\n\n# Load the Shiny library\nlibrary(\"shiny\")\n\n# Define the User Interface (Frontend)\nui <- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"Hello Shiny!\"),\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      sliderInput(inputId = \"bins\",\n                  label = \"Number of bins:\",\n                  min = 1,\n                  max = 50,\n                  value = 30)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(outputId = \"distPlot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define the Server (Backend)\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({\n    x <- faithful$waiting\n    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)\n    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = \"#75AADB\", border = \"white\",\n         xlab = \"Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)\",\n         main = \"Histogram of waiting times\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Launch the shiny app\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nTask: In your group, compare the code with the below illustration of the anatomy of your first shiny app. Pay specific attention to the input- and output-variables and how the inputId = \"bins\" end up in input$bins. This front-to-back-end communication is central!\n\n\n\nTask: To further understand what is going on, we can ask constructively for input. Let us use your favourite LLM-technology as a sparring partner, e.g. you can cope/paste the following into a chatGPT prompt:\n\nI am following the university course \"R for Bio Data Science\".\nToday we are learning about Shiny, which is completely new to me.\nThe first thing we have done is to re-create a small shiny app,\nwhich is part of the examples in the Shiny-package. Moreover,\nit is the example which can be seen by running the code:\n  \n`runExample(\"01_hello\")`\n\nNow, we have manually implemented the app, but I am not certain\nof how it works and the details. In the following, I will\npaste the code from the app. Please in details, minding that I\nam a begginer, explain the details of the code:\n\nPASTE THE APP CODE HERE\n\nTask: Furthermore, let us also get some input on how the illustration above maps to the code. Right-click the “Shiny” image above and save it to disk, then copy/paste the following into the same prompt:\n\nThe lecturer has given me this graphical illustration,\nbut I am not sure I understand how it maps to the code,\ncan you please explain?\n\nREMEMBER TO UPLOAD THE IMAGE\n  \n\nTask: Now, look at the answers you got, if something is unclear, ask for an elaboration, e.g.:\n\nI have not seen the terms \"user interface\" or \"frontend\"\nor \"backend\" before. Please briefly explain, what these\nmean and how they are related to building shiny apps  \nNote here, how we using the LLM-technology productively as a sparring-partner. Instead of asking it to produce code, we ask it to explain existing code and to elaborate on any unclear specifics\n\n\nYour Second Shiny App\nWe will continue where we left of last week. To make sure, that everyone is working with the same functions, we will use the functions outlined below here. Remember the task here is to build an interface, which allow people without coding skills to interact with data.\nLet’s get started!\n\n\nClick here for functions\n\n\nPlease note, that as an example of reducing dependencies, these functions are implemented using base R. In case you are not familiar, here again is a prime example of using LLM-technology such as e.g. chatGPT as a sparring partner. Try to submit the following prompt:\nI am not familiar with base R, I only know tidyverse R.\nFor the following function and R-code, please explain\nin detail how the used base R functions work and what\nthe code in its entirety does:\n\nPASTE THE BASE R CODE OF A FUNCTION HERE\n\n\nVirtual Gene\n\n\n\n# Virtual gene\ngene_dna <- function(length, base_probs = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25)){\n  if( length %% 3 != 0 ){\n    stop(\"The argument to the parameter 'l' has to be divisible by 3\")\n  }\n  dna_vector <- sample(\n    x = c(\"A\", \"T\", \"C\", \"G\"),\n    size = length,\n    replace = TRUE,\n    prob = base_probs)\n  dna_string <- paste0(\n    x = dna_vector,\n    collapse = \"\")\n  return(dna)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual RNA Polymerase\n\n\n\n# Virtual RNA polymerase\ntranscribe_dna <- function(dna){\n  rna <- gsub(\n    pattern = \"T\",\n    replacement = \"U\",\n    x = dna)\n  return(rna)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Ribosome\n\n\n\n# Virtual Ribosome\ntranslate_rna <- function(rna){\n  l <- nchar(x = rna)\n  firsts <- seq(\n    from = 1,\n    to = l,\n    by = 3)\n  lasts <- seq(\n    from = 3,\n    to = l,\n    by = 3)\n  codons <- substring(\n    text = rna,\n    first = firsts,\n    last = lasts)\n  codon_table <- c(\n    \"UUU\" = \"F\", \"UCU\" = \"S\", \"UAU\" = \"Y\", \"UGU\" = \"C\",\n    \"UUC\" = \"F\", \"UCC\" = \"S\", \"UAC\" = \"Y\", \"UGC\" = \"C\",\n    \"UUA\" = \"L\", \"UCA\" = \"S\", \"UAA\" = \"_\", \"UGA\" = \"_\",\n    \"UUG\" = \"L\", \"UCG\" = \"S\", \"UAG\" = \"_\", \"UGG\" = \"W\",\n    \"CUU\" = \"L\", \"CCU\" = \"P\", \"CAU\" = \"H\", \"CGU\" = \"R\",\n    \"CUC\" = \"L\", \"CCC\" = \"P\", \"CAC\" = \"H\", \"CGC\" = \"R\",\n    \"CUA\" = \"L\", \"CCA\" = \"P\", \"CAA\" = \"Q\", \"CGA\" = \"R\",\n    \"CUG\" = \"L\", \"CCG\" = \"P\", \"CAG\" = \"Q\", \"CGG\" = \"R\",\n    \"AUU\" = \"I\", \"ACU\" = \"T\", \"AAU\" = \"N\", \"AGU\" = \"S\",\n    \"AUC\" = \"I\", \"ACC\" = \"T\", \"AAC\" = \"N\", \"AGC\" = \"S\",\n    \"AUA\" = \"I\", \"ACA\" = \"T\", \"AAA\" = \"K\", \"AGA\" = \"R\",\n    \"AUG\" = \"M\", \"ACG\" = \"T\", \"AAG\" = \"K\", \"AGG\" = \"R\",\n    \"GUU\" = \"V\", \"GCU\" = \"A\", \"GAU\" = \"D\", \"GGU\" = \"G\",\n    \"GUC\" = \"V\", \"GCC\" = \"A\", \"GAC\" = \"D\", \"GGC\" = \"G\",\n    \"GUA\" = \"V\", \"GCA\" = \"A\", \"GAA\" = \"E\", \"GGA\" = \"G\",\n    \"GUG\" = \"V\", \"GCG\" = \"A\", \"GAG\" = \"E\", \"GGG\" = \"G\")\n  protein <- paste0(\n    x = codon_table[codons],\n    collapse = \"\")\n  return(protein)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple base counts\n\n\n\n# Simple base counts\nbase_freqs <- function(x){\n  dna_vec <- strsplit(x = x,\n                      split = \"\")\n  base_counts <- table(dna_vec)\n  return( as.data.frame.table(base_counts) )\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a Virtual Gene Generator\n\n\nVersion 1, the basics\nBelow here, you will find some boilerplate code, which is based on what you saw in the 01_hello-example.\n\nTask: Look at this code and compare it to your first shiny app, discuss the changes in your group, what do you see?\nTask: Create your second Shiny App in a new file virtual_gene_generator.R, copy/paste making sure to insert the code needed for the function gene_dna() (See code for functions above)\nTask: Run the App and in your group, discuss how it works\n\n\nlibrary(\"shiny\")\n\n# Define the \"Virtual Gene\"-function (See code for functions above)\ngene_dna <- ...\n\n# Define the User Interface (Frontend)\nui <- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"Virtual Gene Generator\"),\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      sliderInput(inputId = \"n_bases\",\n                  label = \"Number of bases:\",\n                  min = 1,\n                  max = 60,\n                  value = 30)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      textOutput(outputId = \"dna\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define the Server (Backend)\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  output$dna <- renderText({\n    gene_dna(length = input$n_bases)\n  })\n}\n\n# Launch the shiny app\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nVersion 2, expanding\nNow, if you look at the code for the gene_dna-function, it has a second parameter base_probs with the default argument c(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25). Let us now expand, so your app allows the user to define the individual base probabilities.\n\nTask: Expand the ui with one numericInput() for each of the four bases defining the probability of drawing that base and pass those numbers onto the server\n\n\n\n\nNeed a hint?\n\n\nRecall, that you in the console can type ?numericInput and get help on the function. Try to do so and compare with the sliderInput() you already have defined in your app.\nTip: Start with just one probability and then hardcode the other 3 to e.g. 0.25\n\n\n\n\nNeed a hint more?\n\n\nThe inputId defines the “name” of what is passed to the server, e.g. if you look at the sliderInput() it uses inputId = \"n_bases\", which is then passed to the server as input$n_bases\n\n\n\n\nNeed just one hint more?\n\n\nIn your ui, you have to find room for:\n\nnumericInput(inputId = \"prob_A\",\n             label = \"Probability of A\",\n             value = 0.25,\n             min = 0,\n             max = 1)\n\nIn your server you have to find room for:\n\nbase_probs = c(input$prob_A, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25)\n\nand then figure out how to expand that to also include prob_T, prob_C and prob_G\n\nOnce you are up and running, your app should look something like this:\n\n\nTask: Update the gene_dna()-function in your app to check if the probabilities sum to 1 and make sure output a meaningful error message, if they do not\n\n\n\n\nNeed a hint?\n\n\nThe gene_dna()-function already checks it the length of the DNA is divisible by 3, use this as inspiration to add your own check. If you are uncertain on how to compute the sum() of a vector in R, try to google a bit…\n\n\n\n\nA bit more advanced hint\n\n\nActually, you should be careful when comparing numbers when you create apps or any analysis code. If you sum a large vector, you might experience, that even when the sum should be equal to 1, it will fail a direct comparison, such as sum(p) == 1. This has to do with internal representation of numbers in a computer resulting in small rounding errors. Therefore, it is safer to use e.g.: abs(sum(p) - 1) < 1e-10, i.e. is the difference between my sum and the number 1 smaller than some very small number.\n\n\n\n\nControlling the Layout\nBy now your base app is up and running, but you may want to tinker with the layout of the user interface. We can do so using the card()-function from the bslib-package:\n\n\nClick to expand app code\n\n\n\n# Define the User Interface (Frontend)\nui <- page_fluid(\n  layout_columns(\n    col_widths = 12,\n    card(\n      titlePanel(\"Virtual Central Dogma\"),\n      style = \"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 15px;\"\n    )),\n  layout_columns(\n    col_widths = 12,\n    card(\n      titlePanel(\"About\"),\n      helpText(\"Describe what your app does...\")\n    )),\n  layout_columns(\n    col_widths = 12,\n    card(\n      card_header(\"Virtual Gene Generator\"),\n      sliderInput(inputId = \"n_bases\",\n                  label = \"Number of bases:\",\n                  min = 1,\n                  max = 60,\n                  value = 30,\n                  width = \"100%\"),\n      layout_columns(\n        col_widths = c(3, 3, 3, 3),\n        numericInput(inputId = \"prob_A\",\n                     label = \"Probability of A\",\n                     value = 0.25,\n                     min = 0,\n                     max = 1,\n                     step = 0.1),\n        numericInput(inputId = \"prob_T\",\n                     label = \"Probability of T\",\n                     value = 0.25,\n                     min = 0,\n                     max = 1,\n                     step = 0.1),\n        numericInput(inputId = \"prob_C\",\n                     label = \"Probability of C\",\n                     value = 0.25,\n                     min = 0,\n                     max = 1,\n                     step = 0.1),\n        numericInput(inputId = \"prob_G\",\n                     label = \"Probability of G\",\n                     value = 0.25,\n                     min = 0,\n                     max = 1,\n                     step = 0.1)\n    ))),\n  layout_columns(\n    col_widths = 12,\n    card(\n      card_header(\"Virtual Gene output\"),\n      mainPanel(\n        verbatimTextOutput(outputId = \"dna\")\n      )\n    ))\n)\n\n\n\nTask: Update your app using the above card()-function layout\n\n\n\nIt’s Complicated…\nAs you have probably realised by now, the final app can be rather many lines of code defining the user interface and likewise for the server and also associated functions. To address this, it is recommendable to divide your app into seperate files mimicking the illustration of the anatomy of a Shiny app. To do so, we will need four files:\n\nThe functions: app_functions.R\nThe user interface: ui.R\nThe server: server.R\nThe app: virtual_central_dogma.R\n\nThe latter will look something like this:\n\n# Load needed libraries\nlibrary(\"PACKAGE_NAME\")\n\n# Load needed functions\nsource(file = \"app_functions.R\")\n\n# Run the frontend user interface ui.R\nsource(file = \"ui.R\")\n\n# Run the backend server server.R\nsource(file = \"server.R\")\n\n# Run the Shiny app\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\nTask: First make sure, that your app runs as is and then create these four files and copy/paste the approproiate code into each of the files\n\n\n\nCompleting the Central Dogma\nSo far you have just been working with the gene_dna()-function, but we naturally have to also include:\n\nTranscription\nTranslation\nA bit of analysis\n\nIf you scroll a bit back, you were given some pre-built code for the following functions:\n\ngene_dna()\ntranscribe_dna()\ntranslate_rna()\nbase_freqs()\n\nRight then:\n\nTask: Expand your app to include the central dogma functions gene_dna(), transcribe_dna() and translate_rna(). Note that any further analysis, such as e.g. base_freqs() or similar is optional\n\nA bit of help to get you started:\n\nYou can find an overview of the different input controls here\n\n\n\nGetting Your Shiny App LIVE!\nNote, when we publish our app, each file will be “build” and this will create errors if some functions are not found. Therefore, make sure to include library(\"PACKAGE_NAME\") in each files for all needed libraries\n\nGo to shinyapps.io\nLog in or create an account\nGo back to your RStudio session and launch your Shiny App\nIn the upper right corner, it’ll say “Publish”\nYou may get prompted to install some packages, so go ahead and do so\nYou will then get prompted to “Connect Publishing Account”, click “Next”\nChoose your “ShinyApps.io” account\nFollow the outlined connect procedure\nChoose a “Title” for your app\nClick “Publish”\n\nAfter some automated build procedures, your Shiny App is LIVE - CONGRATULATIONS!\nNB! If you an error saying:\n\n“An error has occurred! An error has occurred. Check your logs or contact the app author for clarification.”\n\nThen likely, there is a problem withs paths or libraries, did you remember to start this last part as a seperate project? Also, did you remember to include library definitions in all 3 files?"

These are different, one is a folder, data, and the other is a file, r_for_bio_data_science.Rproj, containing settings for your RStudio Project.\nLet us try to put som data into the data-folder. In the console window, run the following command\n\nwrite.table(x = datasets::Puromycin, file = \"data/puromycin.tsv\", sep = \"\\t\")\n\nThis should look like so:\n\nThis command write a table containing the Puromycin from an R-package named datasets, this is done using the x-parameter. The next paramter is file and we set that to indicate, that the file should go into the data-folder we created and that we would like the file to be named puromycin.tsv, where tsv is an abbreviation for tab-separated-values and then the last parameter sep is set to \"\\t\" indicating, that we want the values to be separated by a tab, as indicated, when we named the file.\nOnce you have run the command, click the data-folder and you should now see:\n\nAgain, click .., this will take you one level up, so you again see:\n\nNow, we have a data file called puromycin.tsv. Let us read that file into R. We can do that like so:\n\nmy_data <- read.table(file = \"puromycin.tsv\")\n\nEnter the command into the console and run it like we did before. You will now see the following:\n\nSo, what happend? The blue writing is your command and the red is an error message from R. Always read error messages carefully, they will inform you what went wrong. In this case, we can see that cannot open file 'puromycin.tsv': No such file or directory.\nThis happened because we forgot to specify where the puromycin.tsv-file is located. R is very picky here, you have to specify exactly where R should find things. Recall, that we decided to create a data-folder and that we placed the puromycin.tsv-file into that folder. This we have to specify, when we use the file parameter in the read.table()-function. So, let us fix that:\n\nmy_data <- read.table(file = \"data/puromycin.tsv\")\n\nThis data/puromycin.tsv is the path to the file and now, that we have got that correct, you will see no error message and furthermore, you will see in the environment-pane, that we now have an object called my_data, containing 23 obs. of 3 varibles, i.e. a data set with 23 rows and 3 columns."

You can verify, that we are indeed working in that project, by looking in the upper right corner of the RStudio IDE and you should see  r_for_bio_data_science.\nGood, now in the console, enter the command:\n\ngetwd()\n\nYou should see something along the lines of:\n\n\"/net/pupilx/home/people/student_id/projects/r_for_bio_data_science\"\n\nSo, when we read the puromycin.tsv-file using the path data/puromycin.tsv, we specify, that R should look for the file puromycin.tsv in the data folder. So why did we not have to specify /net/pupilx/home/people/student_id/projects/r_for_bio_data_science? Well indeed, we could have specified the full location of the puromycin.tsv-file, which would be:\n\n\"/net/pupilx/home/people/student_id/projects/r_for_bio_data_science/data/puromycin.tsv\"\n\nThis is called the absolute path and here you should note, that it begins with a /. But let us say, that we had indeed in our code stated:\n\nmy_data <- read.table(file = \"/net/pupilx/home/people/student_id/projects/r_for_bio_data_science/data/puromycin.tsv\")\n\nThen that would work… On OUR computer. If we were to share our code to a colleague or a collaborator, then that would not work, because that person would have a different path, e.g. a different student_id. The code would break! Imagine that you have thousands of line of code with hundreds of absolute paths - You would spend hours-and-hours on fixing all the absolute paths, so they matched that particular computer. Then every time we would want to share the analysis project, we would have to redo this tedious proces!\nThis is why we work in RStudio Projects! RStudio Projects allows us to specifiy where everything is located relative to where the .Rproj-file is. So in our case, the r_for_bio_data_science.Rproj-file is located in the same place as the data-folder, namely in the folder containing our entire project, the r_for_bio_data_science-folder, which in turn is located in the projects-folder.\nThis means, that all paths in the analysis project, can be stated relative to the location of the .Rproj-file and hence we have relative paths, meaning that anyone can receive the project and run it straight-out-of-the-box!"

Now you will se a dialogue window open, i.e. RStudio requires input from you:\n\nClick  New Directory and you should see:\n\nClick  New Project:\n\nIn the Directory name:, enter e.g. introduction_to_systems_biology:\n\nand then click Create Project. Now, you should see:\n\nNow, note how you now see  Home > projects > introduction_to_systems_biology, meaning that you are now in your Home and then in your folder containing projects, one of which is your introduction_to_systems_biology project.\nClick .. and you will see:\n\nThis is now your two project folders and you can add others, such as yet another course or e.g. special_course, bachelor_thesis or master_thesis.\nNow, we can easily switch between different projects. In the upper right corner you will see, that you are currently in the introduction_to_systems_biology project, meaning that R will look for all files relative to the introduction_to_systems_biology.Rproj-file. Naturally, we would want to switch back to the project, we created for the “R for Bio Data Science”-course. To do this, we simply click  introduction_to_systems_biology and if you look at the drop-down menu, you should see r_for_bio_data_science - Click it! Notice how R automatically restarts and you are moved to the correct folder for this project.\nMake sure to change your active project back to r_for_bio_data_Science before doing further lab exercises!"

This facilitates lower maintanence on code. Imagine the case, where you are perhaps 10 bio data scientists working on e.g. an R-package, which will used downstream by another department. You really need to make sure, that everything is top notch, so you decide to do code reviewing. You write your code up and then your colleague will go over the code to check it. But you and your colleague have completely different opinions on how the code should be styled. This will result in an unnecessary time overhead. Another case, could be a colleague leaving for another position, where you then have to take over that colleague’s code base and you end up re-styling the code, so it matches your preferences, again this will increase maintenance unnecessarily. The solution is to agree on a set of rules and principles on how to style your code - This is code styling!\nBelow follows the code styling you will have to adhere to in this course"

    "text": "Example\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nLet’s say we wanted to study the genetic mechanism protecting a plant from heat shock, then:\n\nIndependent: Environmental Condition (temperature)\nDependent: Gene Expression Level (related to heat shock protection)\n\nHere, the independent variable is the temperature and the dependent variable is the gene expression level. It is clear, that the temperature, does not rely on the gene expression level, but the gene expression level of heat shock related genes, does rely on the temperature.\nSo, we keep plants under different temperatures and collect samples, from which we can extract RNA and run a transcriptomics analysis uncovering gene expression levels.\n\n\nData\nFor the data here, we are going to simulate the relationship between gene expression levels and temperature, as a function in R:\n\nrun_simulation <- function(temp){\n  measurement_error <- rnorm(n = length(temp), mean = 0, sd = 3)\n  gene_expression_level <- 2 * temp + 3 + measurement_error\n  return( gene_expression_level )\n}\n\nNote, how we’re adding some measurement error to our simulation, otherwise we would get a perfect relationship, which we all know never happens.\nNow, we can easily run simulations:\n\nrun_simulation(temp = c(15, 20, 25, 30, 35))\n\n[1] 35.21815 42.59250 56.20864 59.35609 67.95594\n\n\nLet’s just go ahead and create some data, we can work with. For this example, we take samples starting at 5 degree celsius and then in increments of 1 up to 50 degrees:\n\nset.seed(806017)\nexperiment_data <- tibble(\n  temperature = seq(from = 5, to = 50, by = 1),\n  gene_expression_level = run_simulation(temp = temperature)\n)\nexperiment_data |> \n  sample_n(10) |> \n  arrange(temperature)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   temperature gene_expression_level\n         <dbl>                 <dbl>\n 1          12                  28.7\n 2          13                  30.2\n 3          16                  35.6\n 4          19                  44.0\n 5          22                  48.8\n 6          27                  64.6\n 7          32                  61.1\n 8          33                  73.9\n 9          35                  76.7\n10          40                  84.9\n\n\n\n\nVisualising\nNow, that we have the data, we can visualise the relationship between the temperature- and gene_expression_level-variables:\n\nmy_viz <- experiment_data |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = temperature,\n             y = gene_expression_level)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)\nmy_viz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can easily add the best fit line using the geom_smooth()-function, where we specify that we want to use method = \"lm\" and for now, we exclude the confidence interval, by setting se = FALSE:\n\nmy_viz +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",\n              se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens here, is that a best-fit line is added to the plot by calculating the line, such that the sum of the squared errors is as small as possible, where the error is the distance from the line to a given point. This is a basic linear regression and is known as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). But what if we want to work with this regression model, beyond just adding a line to a plot?\n\n\nModelling\nOne of the super powers of R is the build in capability to do modelling. Because we simulated the data (see above), we know that the true intercept is 3 and the true slope of the temperature variable is 2. Let see what we get, if we run a linear model:\n\nmy_lm_mdl <- lm(formula = gene_expression_level ~ temperature,\n   data = experiment_data)\nmy_lm_mdl\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = gene_expression_level ~ temperature, data = experiment_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)  temperature  \n      2.816        2.021  \n\n\nImportant, the formula notation gene_expression_level ~ temperature is central to R and should be read as: “gene_expression_level modelled as a function of temperature”, i.e. gene_expression_level is the dependent variable often denoted y and temperature is the independendt variable often denoted x.\nOkay that’s pretty close! Recall the reason for the difference is, that we are adding measurement error, when we run the simulation (see above).\nIn other words our model says, that:\n\\[gene\\_expression\\_level = 2.816 + 2.021 \\cdot temperature\\]\nI.e. the estimate of the intercept is 2.816 and the estimate of the slope is 2.021, meaning that when the temperature = 0, we estimate that the gene_expression_level is 2.816 and for each 1 degree increase in temperature, we estimate, that the increase in gene_expression_level is 2.021.\nThese estimates are pretty close to the true model underlying our simulation:\n\\[gene\\_expression\\_level = 3 + 2 \\cdot temperature\\]\nIn general form, such a linear model can be written like so:\n\\[y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\cdot x_{1}\\]\nWhere the \\(\\beta\\)-coefficients are termed estimates, because that is exactly what we do, given the observed data, we estimate their values.\n\n\nWorking with a lm-object:\nThe model format you saw above, is a bit quirky, but luckily, there is a really nice way to get these kind of model object into a more tidy-format:\n\nlibrary(\"broom\")\nmy_lm_mdl |> \n  tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)     2.82    1.16        2.44 1.89e- 2\n2 temperature     2.02    0.0378     53.4  1.16e-41\n\n\nBriefly, here we term, estimate, std.error, statistic and p.value. We discussed the term and estimate. The std.error pertains to the estimate and the statistic is used to calculate the p.value.\n\nThe P-value\nNow, because we now have a tidy object, we can simply plug-‘n’-play with other tidyverse tools, so let us visualise the p.value. Note, because of the often vary large differences in p.values, we use a -log10-transformation, this means that larger values are “more significant”. Below, the dashed line signifies \\(p=0.05\\), so anything above that line is considered “statistically significant”:\n\nmy_lm_mdl |> \n  tidy() |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = term,\n             y = -log10(p.value))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05),\n             linetype = \"dashed\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, as mentioned the p-values are computed based on the statistic and are defined as: “The probability of observing a statistic as or more extreme given, that the null-hypothesis is true”. Where the null-hypothesis it that there is no effect, i.e. the estimate for the term is zero.\nFrom this, it is quite clear, that there very likely is a relationship between the gene_expression_level and temperature. In fact, we know there is, because we simulated the data.\n\n\nThe Confidence Intervals\nWe can further easily include the confidence intervals of the estimates:\n\nmy_lm_mdl_tidy <- my_lm_mdl |> \n  tidy(conf.int = TRUE,\n       conf.level = 0.95)\nmy_lm_mdl_tidy\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)     2.82    1.16        2.44 1.89e- 2    0.488      5.14\n2 temperature     2.02    0.0378     53.4  1.16e-41    1.94       2.10\n\n\n…and as before easily do a plug’n’play into ggplot:\n\nmy_lm_mdl_tidy |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate,\n             y = term,\n             xmin = conf.low,\n             xmax = conf.high)) +\n  geom_errorbarh(height = 0.1) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, what the 0.95 = 95% confidence intervals means is that: “If we were to repeat this experiment 100 times, then 95 of the times, the generated confidence interval would contain the true value”.\n\n\n\nSummary\nWhat we have gone through here is a basic linear regression, where we are aiming to model the continuous variable gene_expression_level as a function of yet another continous variable temperature. We simulated data, where the true intercept and slope were 3 and 2 respectively and by fitting a linear regression model, the estimates of the intercept and slope respectively were 2.82 [0.49;5.14] and 2.02 [1.94;2.10].\nLinear models allow us to gain insights into data, by modelling relationships."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are a few things to know when creating a package before you jump in. These are not strict rules, but they make your life easier when bug-fixing and make the package much easier to use for the users. Learn about the dos and don’ts in the following.\n\n\nThe one strict rule is Never use library(\"package\") within a package! \nInstead, add the packages your are going to use to the DESCRIPTION file and in the function descriptions. This is done by running usethis::use_package(\"packageName\") in the console and adding @import package (OK) or @importFrom package function1 function2 ... (Best). Using the functions in your package is then done with package::function() (e.g., dplyr::mutate()) or omitting the package::.\nThis way, it is easy to read what functions are from your package, and your package namespace does not get cluttered. Read more in the Namespace section.\nIt should also be a goal to make your package depend on as few other packages as possible. The user will need to install all packages your package depends on, but then also every package those depends on - that list quickly becomes quite long if you are not careful.\n\n\n\nA package is typically a collections of functions.\nThese functions are stored in .R files in the R folder. A good starting point is to create an .R file for each function. But, as the package becomes bigger, it often makes sense to combine related functions into bigger files.\nYou can quickly create a new .R file with usethis::use_r(\"function_name\"). Or do it manually, as you are used to.\n\n\n\nTry running ?mean in the Console.\nIf you have every wondered how to write a manual like the one that pops up, please click here and read - if not, consider reading it anyway, as you will use it later.\nWhen you have made a function, or have at least defined one, you should describe what it does and how to use it. The manual you write for your function is the function documentation, and it should describe the purpose of the function and how to use it.\nYou can read extensively about it here, but I will give you the most essential information to get you started.\nThe R package roxygen2 makes this easy as 1-2-3. It is part of devtools and is already installed. It uses #' comments above the function. @ tags lets you add specific details to the function documentation.\nCreate an roxygen skeleton by clicking somewhere in your function. Go to the ‘Code’ tab in the top of your window and select ‘Insert Roxygen Skeleton’.\nThis will look something like this:\n\n#' Title\n#'\n#' @param foo \n#' @param bar \n#'\n#' @return\n#' @export\n#'\n#' @examples\nmyFunction <- function(foo, bar){\n  # Do stuff with foo and bar\n  foobar <- (foo * bar) / (foo + bar)\n  return(foobar)\n}\n\nThis allows you to add the most basic descriptions. To begin with, the Title, @param, and @export are the most important, you may remove the other tags for now. A more detailed example is given here. There, you can also read about documenting datasets and other object types - even the package itself.\n\n\n\nYour package namespace can quickly become very cluttered, if you are not careful.\nTherefore, follow these rules:\n\nOnly @export the functions the users will use. Removing the tag makes the function internal and hides it from your package namespace. It can still be freely used within your package and accessed outside your package with package:::internal_function()\nMake your code explicit with package::function().\n\nThis step is not mandatory, but makes reading the code easier.\n\nAdd your dependencies in the DESCRIPTION file with usethis::use_package(\"packageName\")\nOnly very rarely use the @import tag. Aim to use the @importFrom tags in your function descriptions instead.\n\nYou can read more extensively about namespace here.\n\n\n\nTesting is essential\n\nto ensure your package runs smoothly and that no bugs are introduced when you make a seemingly minor change. It is handled with the testthat package, which is also installed with devtools.\nI will not go into too much detail here, but know that testing is an important, but often neglected, part of building a package. You can read more about it here.\nEvery time you run the usethis::use_r() function to create a new script, the function encourages you to create a test alongside the new function. I recommend you follow that advise.\nYou create a test by running usethis::use_test(\"function name\").\nThe function creates a new folder tests and creates a test script for the function. The good R package creator writes a few tests for every function.\nThe exercises will ask you to make a simple test for every function, introducing you to the concept.\n\n\n\nWhen creating a package, it is important to test your work along the way.\nYou can do that in many ways, but I recommend the following workflow:\n\nWrite a function / make a change\n\nIf it is a new function, document it\n\nSave your files: rstudioapi::documentSaveAll()\nCreate package documentation: devtools::document()\n\n\nIf at this point, you get a warning that NAMESPACE already exists, delete it and try again.\n\n\nLoad package: devtools::load_all()\nYour package is now loaded, and you can test that it works as intended.\n\nOptionally, you can save the three lines of code in dev/load.R and run the lines with source(\"dev/load.R\"). If you do, add the dev folder to the .Rbuildignore file."

Here, you can even consider improving the data visualisations or adding something extra\nDo not use a data set from one of the course exercises. Doing so would not allow you to demonstrate that you are independently capable of performing a bio data science analysis\nYou are 100% free to choose bio data from any resource as long as it meets the above requirements\nBe sure to understand that the purpose of the project is for you to synthesise an end-to-end Bio Data Science project demonstrating, that you have met the learning objectives of the course, as stated at the individual labs and on the DTU course base. Hence and importantly, your data must allow you to do so!\n\n\n\nHow should we handle NAs in the data?\n\nDepends, does your data set come with a readme, which allows you to make a decision regarding NAs?\nBe careful not to simply drop all NAs as you might drop observations, where columns of interest have complete data\nWhether to remove NAs or not cannot be universally answered, as it is specific to the challenge / data at hand. If it’s meaningful for you to keep NAs, then do so, if not, then remove them.\n\n\n\nHow should we handle binary variables?\n\nIn case your variable contains categories, i.e. values, where the question “Is one larger than the other” is nonsensical, then encode as factors\n\n\n\nHow do we handle nonsensical data points?\n\nIf you believe the data points are nonsensical, e.g. manual typing errors, then exclude them, but be very clear about which data (groups of) points were excluded and why\n\n\n\nCan we subset the data?\n\nYes, if you are particularly interested in a subset of the data, then that is perfectly fine. Just be aware, that any choice you take with the data, you must be able to account for why you took that choice\nYou should NOT just sample 100 observations as was done in the exercises to reduce runtime. However, if your data set is very large, consider down-sampling either randomly or by some metric of association. For the latter e.g. perform a test and identify the top X observations, save those to file and continue from there.\nFor large data, try appending “.gz” to your files, when you write them using write_tsv(), this will invoke gzip-compression"

Therefore, do not start fitting a full fledged machine/deep learning model, it is a time-void, which you cannot “afford” to get sucked into\nAlso, mind that the focus of this course is to make you realise that even though you have been trained in delivering results, then the process of arriving at the results in a reproducible manner is equally important - The process is the product!\n\n\n\nDo we HAVE to do a PCA?\n\nDoes it make sense to do a PCA-analysis in your project? If you have group labels and you want to visualise to see if there is a separation, then a PCA is a good first step\n\n\n\nOur model is not “performing very well”. What should we do?\n\nLeave it as is. The focus of this course is not on the results, but on the reproducible process of arriving and communicating said results"

    "text": "Coding\n\nWhat goes in “augment”?\n\nIf you google “Augment“, you will get “make (something) greater by adding to it; increase”, in other words, when you add e.g. variables to your data, which was not there initially, e.g. like we did, when we calculated the BMI from existing information on weight and height\nYou should think of the augment script as the place, where you create your “database” for everything that happens afterwards, i.e. all your analyses and ideas\nCreate that “database” and then load it into your downstream scripts\nAugment == Adding something\nBe aware, that if you downstream discover a need to create a variable, you will need to go back to the augment and update\n\n\n\nCan we mix base R and tidyverse?\n\nNo, you might as well get used to it - Tidyverse all the way! (This is a tidyverse course)\nIf you use base, like e.g. my_data$my_var <- 1:4 or my_data$my_var[1] or similar, then you will get points deducted in the evaluation of your project\nAgain, the process is the product and it matters much if you are using the course correct dialect of R. What you choose to do after the course is your choice\nUsing base R, where course content contains describes the tidyverse alternative is no different from using python and I suppose you wouldn’e expect to be able to hand in python code as the final product in an R course\n\n\n\nWhat if we can’t make it work in tidyverse but only in base R?\n\nIf you can make it work in base R, you can make it work in tidyverse\n\n\n\nIs it okay to use e.g. the base function sum()?\n\nYes, think of it this way: R has as core functionality to do statistics. Tidyverse is for performing the data manipulation surrounding these calculations. Therefore, using functions such as sum(), mean(), sd(), etc. is naturally fine\nE.g. recall, when we did the group_by() \\(\\rightarrow\\) summarise()-workflow, we used the descriptive statistics functions\nAlso, we used the lm()-function for fitting a linear regression.\nTidyverse aims to replace the inconsistent and low legibility of base R with respect to data manipulation and visualisation - It does not replace the core functionality of doing statistics\n\n\n\nHow do we know if there is a tidyverse function we should use rather than base?\n\nIdentify the general area of what you’re working with. E.g. if strings, then go to your RStudio session and find the console and type stringr:: and hit tab, then you can look through the functions\nLook and search in the R4DS2e-book\nAsk on the Posit community pages\nAlso generally base will use e.g. read.table(), where tidyverse will use read_table(), i.e. a period vs. an underscore\n\n\n\nCan we use package X for analysis/visualisation?\n\nIf the package performs a lot of the work, which you are to demonstrate that you can do, then absolutely no. E.g. DO NOT use packages, where you call a plot-my-data-function and the ggplot-magick happens that will NOT allow you to demonstrate that you have met the course learning objectives\nFor an example of and-then-magic-happens, see e.g. the corrplot-package\nBasically, any package, which automatically does “things”, that are part of the learning objectives, will not allow you to demonstrate, that you have met the learning objectives!\n\n\n\nHow do we run the entire project incl. the presentation?\n\nMake sure to include a programmatic call to render a file, i.e. in your run-all qmd file, when you include sub-documents and run the run-all file, the sub-files will not be generated, hence you need to include a programmatic call in your run-all file, which will also render the seperate sub-documents\nNote, you can include one Quarto document in another\n\n\n\nShould we create a Shiny app?\n\nThe project deliverables are the GitHub repo and your presentation\nRemember, you do this project not for me as “your teacher”, but for you to internalize the knowledge you have been exposed to during the initial 10 weeks of teaching\nIf you find Shiny interesting/fun, then by all means, please do create an app\nNote, Shiny apps are optional and will not give extra credit - Be careful with your time!\n\n\n\nShould we create a package?\n\nIf you find Rpackages interesting/fun, then by all means, please do create an Rpackage\nNote, Rpackages are optional and will not give extra credit - Be careful with your time!\n\n\n\nWhen should we create functions?\n\nRemember DRY (Don’t-Repeat-Yourself), so generally, if you do something more than once, it is a function\nHowever, we do not focus much on functions in this course, so don’t put too much effort into creating functions\nPlace functions in 99_proj_functions.R as illustrated in the overview\nDO NOT hide your code away in functions, so that your main script just becomes 10 function calls. For this process-oriented course, show the code in your main qmd-documents, i.e. 01_, 02_, …\n\n\n\nCan we use loops?\n\nNo, you should instead embrace functional programming and use functions from the purrr-package. Revisit lab 6, if needed\n\n\n\nCan we directly copy/paste a code chunk from an online source?\n\nNo, that would be plagiarism. Understand the steps in the chunk and make the code your own\nI acknowledge that for coding this is not completely black and white, but please refrain from a direct copy/paste\n\n\n\nCan we use chatGPT or similar for coding?\n\nNo, of course not, the coding has to be done by the students, not an AI\nHow would you know if we used an AI? I may not be able to tell or I may be, I wouldn’t recommend taking the risk\nOnce through this course, AIs can be a powerful allied, but it requires skills and experience to use an AI productively, otherwise you will end up in “traps”"

    "text": "Coding style\n\nHow should we comment on our code?\n\nRemember, the point of writing verbose tidyverse code is that the code-becomes-the-comments. Think of it this way: The pipeline is the text on a page in a book, so before your pipeline, put a header/title on what is happening below, just as a title/header in a book\nThe title/header will be what is generally going on, e.g. “Normalise all gene expression values using standard score approach” and the pipeline will be how that is actually done\nThe pipe “%>%” is pronounced as “then”, when you “read” your code\n\n\n\nHow should we style our code?\n\nStrictly adhere to the Course Style Guide as introduced in the course\nMake sure that all scripts are styled the same way and be consistent in your coding style\nYour code should not be >80 chars wide, follow the vertical line in your editor\n\n\n\nHow should we style our plots?\n\nBe concise, “less is more”\nMake some nice and relevant plots. Show us that you’ve learned data visualisation. Remember legends, titles etc.\nDo not put 3 messages in 1 plot. Instead put each message into a different plot\nBe very careful with matching the text size in your plots to that of your presentation (trial-and-error)"

If you only have two numerical values, then perhaps a table is fine. If you have 100 observations, then a plot is likely better\nRemember, we are as humans evolutionary encoded to interpret visual information, not numbers\n\n\n\nHow do we add plots to the Quarto presentation?\n\nOutput the plot as a png file using the function ggsave and include that png in your presentation. Think dynamically, we don’t want to type anything manually in our presentation\n\n\n\nHow do we get the presentation in wide-/full screen?\n\nHit w and f while the HTML presentation is loaded\n\n\n\nShould we split our presentation into sub-presentations?\n\nNo, this is not necessary given the extend/size of this project. Just create one qmd-file, which outputs an HTML-presentation\n\n\n\nWe are working on re-creating paper results. Should we re-create the exact same plots?\n\nIdeally, you re-create the plots and then you create your own improved version of the visualisation\n\n\n\nWhere should we “place” our Shiny app in our presentation?\n\nDemo it briefly at the end\n\n\n\nHow can we illustrate our data handling?\n\nConsider creating a flow chart, what are input files and how are they connected to final output?\n\n\n\nHow much code should we include in the presentation?\n\nThe exam deliverables are two-fold. Code is the GitHub repo and your ability to communicate biological insights is in the presentation. Therefore, code could be included in the presentation if you faced and solved a particularly challenging problem in a clever way\n\n\n\nHow do we include data numbers in the presentation?\n\nYou could from your script output a results table with relevant numbers as a .tsv file and then read that into the presentation and extract the numbers\nRemember, think dynamical reporting, what if your input data changes and you manually entered the numbers in your presentation? Then you wouldn’t be much farther than a powerpoint\n\n\n\nWhat goes into the materials and methods section?\n\nMaterials: What data did you use and where did you get it from?\nMethods: Which modelling did you use? Think of the methods section as a recipe for how to go from raw to results => Flow chart?\n\n\n\nShould we interpret our results?\n\nYes, you have to think about it as a “normal” project presentation\n\n\n\nWhat about all the stuff we tried, which did not work?\n\nIn the presentation, you should focus on what worked and what results you arrived at\nExclude dead-ends from the presentation, but… Leave them in the repo, perhaps with an initial comment signifying that the following turned out to be a dead-end\nThink about this - Scenario: You’re working in a company and you and your team of 3 spend 6 months on a project, which turns out to be a dead-end. For future reference: Would the company be interested in knowing that this project was a dead end or should you delete everything and never speak of it again?"
