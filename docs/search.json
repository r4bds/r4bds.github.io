    "text": "A tidy approach to wrangling, exploring, visualising and communicating bio data with an emphasis on doing collaborative and reproducible bioinformatics projects \nLeon Eyrich Jessen & the TA team\n\nWelcome to R for Bio Data Science\nSo, you signed up for the 22100/22160 bioinformatics study line course - Congratulations! That was your first step towards getting a set of bio data science skills, which will serve you through your future career regardless of your path!\nInspirational quotes can be cliche, however this one hits the nail on the head:\n\n“Think about the readability of your code. Every project your work on is fundamentally collaborative. Even if you are not working with any other person, you are always working with future you and you really do not want to be in a situation where future you has no idea what past you was thinking, because past you will not respond to any emails!” Hadley Wickham\n\nBio Data Science in intrinsically collaborative (even if it’s just you working) and intrinsically interdisciplinary, so collaborative-, reproducibility- and communication- skills are key. In this course, you will learn how to do modern project oriented collaborative bio data science in tidyverse R - Welcome!"

    "text": "The course is designed as a semi-flipped classroom, with an emphasis on active learning. This means that during the 4h classes, the first hour will be dedicated to reviewing key points from last week and then a brief introduction to the topic of the day followed by a break. Hereafter, the students will work hands-on in groups on computational exercises using cloud computing infrastructure. The exercises will rely on relevant bioinformatics data from publicly available databases and gradually build the students toolbox with an emphasis on collaborative project work. This part will take up the first 9 labs. Each lab is defined by a set of specified learning objectives, it is essential that students continuously make sure, that they are on track with these LOs.\nThe fist hour of the 10th lab is dedicated to introducing the project part of the course and the subsequent 3h are dedicated to a mini symposium on “Application of R for Bio Data Science in Industry”. Here students will get a change to get insights into how the course topics are implemented in industry and get a glimpse into what options are available upon completing their education. This hybrid event typically attracts ~250 participants and have featured talks from major national and international Pharma/biotech companies, such as: Novo Nordisk, Lundbeck, Chr. Hansen, Bristol Meyer Squibb, a.o.\nIn the project part of the course, students will form groups of 4-5 students based on common interests. Hereafter, the students will seek out and select a data set, which will form the foundation for the project work. In the project work, the students will go through the entire data science cycle and produce the code base for a complete bioinformatics project. This entails a complete synthesis of all components of the exercise labs and supports the collaborative aspect. The groups must then condense the project into a presentation, thereby addressing communicative competencies as an essential part of being a modern bio data scientist."

    "text": "Exercises\nToday, we will focused on getting you started and up and running with the first elements of the course, namely the RStudio IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) and Quarto. If the relationship between R and RStudio is unclear, think of it this way: Consider a car, in that case, R would be the engine and RStudio would be the rest of the car. Neither is particularly useful, but together they form a functioning unit. Before you continue, make sure you in fact did watch the “RStudio for the Total Beginner” video (See the Learning Materials for todays session).\n\nCloud server and the RStudio IDE\nGo to the R for Bio Data Science Cloud Server and follow the login procedure. Upon login, you will see this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the RStudio IDE. It allows you to consolidate all features needed to develop R code for analysis. Now, click Tools \\(\\rightarrow\\) Global Options... \\(\\rightarrow\\) Pane Layout and you will see this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis outlines the four panes you have in your RStudio IDE and allow you rearrange them as you please. Now, re-arrange them, so that they look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Apply \\(\\rightarrow\\) OK and you should see this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst steps\n\nThe Console\nNow, in the console, as you saw in the video, you can type commands like:\n\n2+2\n1:100\n3*3\nsample(1:9)\nX <- matrix(sample(1:9), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)\nX\nsum(X)\nmean(X)\n?sum\nsum\nnucleotides <- c(\"a\", \"c\", \"g\", \"t\")\nnucleotides\nsample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE)\ntable(sample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE))\npaste0(sample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE), collapse = \"\")\nreplicate(n = 10, expr = paste0(sample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE), collapse = \"\"))\ndf <- data.frame(id = paste0(\"seq\", 1:10), seq = replicate(n = 10, expr = paste0(sample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE), collapse = \"\")))\ndf\nstr(df)\nls()\n\nTake some time and play around with these commands and other things you can come up with. Use the ?function to get help on what that function does. Be sure to discuss what you observe in the console. Do not worry too much on the details for now, we are just getting started. But as you hopefully can see, R is very flexible and basically the message is: “If you can think it, you can build it in R”.\n\nGo to Chapter 3 in R4DS2e and do the exercises\n\n\n\nThe Terminal\nNotice how in the console pane, you also get a Terminal, click and enter:\n\nls\nmkdir tmp\ntouch tmp/test.txt\nls tmp\nrm tmp/test.txt\nrmdir tmp\nls\necho $SHELL\n\nBasically, here you have access to a full terminal, which can prove immensely useful! Note, you may or may not be familiar with the concept of a terminal. Simply think of it as a way to interact with the computer using text command, rather than clicking on icons etc. Click back to the console.\n\n\nThe Source\nThe source is where you will write scripts. A script is a series of commands to be executed sequentially, i.e. first line 1, then line 2 and so on. Right now, you should have a open script called Untitled1. If not, you can create a new script by clicking white paper with a round green plus sign in the upper left corner.\nTaking inspiration from the examples above, try to write a series of commands and include a print()-statement at the very end. Click File \\(\\rightarrow\\) Save and save the file as e.g. my_first_script.R. Now, go to the console and type in the command source(\"my_first_script.R\"). Congratulations! You have now written your very first reproducible R-program!\n\n\n\nThe Whole Shebang\nEnough playing around, let us embark on our modern Bio Data Science in R journey.\n\nIn the Files pane, click New Folder and create a folder called projects\nIn the upper right corner, click where it says Project: (None) and then click New Project...\nClick New Directory and then New Project\nIn the Directory name:, enter e.g. r_for_bio_data_science\nClick the Browse... button and select your newly created projects directory and then click Choose\nClick Create Project and wait a bit for it to get created\n\n\nOn Working in Projects\nProjects allow you to create fully transferable bio data science projects, meaning that the root of the project will be where the .Rproj file is located. You can confirm this by entering getwd() in the console. This means that under no circumstance should ever not work in a project nor should ever use absolute paths. Every single path you state in your project must be relative to the project root.\nBut why? Imagine you have create a project, where you have indeed used absolute paths. Now you want to share that project with a colleague. Said colleague gets your project and tests the reproducibility by running the project end-to-end. But it completely fails because you have hardcoded your paths to be absolute, meaning that all files and project ressources locations points to locations on your laptop.\nProjects are a must and allows you to create reproducible encapsulated bio data science projects. Note, the concept of reproducibility is absolute central to this course and must be considered in all aspect of the life cycle of a project!\n\n\nQuarto\nWhile .R-scripts are a perfectly, there is another Skywalker:\n\nIn the upper left corner, again, click the white paper with the round green plus, but this time select Quarto Document\nEnter a Title:, e.g. “Lab 1 Exercises” and enter your name below in the box Author:\nClick Create\nImportant: Save your Quarto document! Click File \\(\\rightarrow\\) Save and name it e.g. lab_01_exercises.qmd\nMinimise the Environment-pane\n\nYou should now see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nTry clicking the Render button just above the quarto-document. This will create the HTML5 output file. Note! You may get a Connection Refused message. If so, don’t worry, just close the page to return to the cloud server and find the generated .html file, left-click and select View in Web Browser.\nIf you have previously worked with Rmarkdown, then many features of Quarto will be familiar. Think of Quarto as the complete rethink of Rmarkdown, i.e. based on all the experience gained, what would the optimal way of constructing an open-source scientific and technical publishing system?\nPerhaps you have previously encountered Jupyter notebooks, Quarto is similar. The basic idea is to have one document covering the entire project cycle.\nProceed R for Data Science (2e), chapter 29 and do the exercises.\n\n\n\nBio Data Science with a Virtual AI Assistant\nI am pretty sure you all know of chatGPT by now, so let us address the elephant in the room!\n\nGetting started\n\nGo to the ChatGPT site\nCreate a user and login\n\n\nLet us get acquainted\nNow, at the bottom it says “Send a message”, let us ask 3 simple question and see if we can find out what is what. Type the following questions in the prompt and read the answers:\n\nExplain in simple terms what you are\nExplain in simple terms how you work\nExplain in simple terms how you can be used to generate value as a virtual AI assistant, when doing Bio Data Science for R\n\n\n\nMoving onto R\nIn the upper left corner, it says + New chat, click it to start a new session.\nAgain, type the following questions in the prompt and read the answers:\n\nR\nWhat is R?\nGive a few simple examples\n\nIf you do get some code examples, try to copy/paste into the console in RStudio and see if they run\n\n\nPrompt Engineering\nStart a new chat and enter:\n\nGive a few simple examples\n\nCompare the response with the one from before, is it the same or different and why so?\nDiscuss in your group what is “Prompt Engineering” and how does it relate to the above few tests you did? (Bonus info: Prompt engineer is already a job and people are making money off of selling prompts)\n\n\n…a bit more\nStart a new chat and enter:\n\nTell me about DNA\n\nCheck if it gives you correct information?\nNow, write:\n\nGive a few fun examples on how to get started with the R programming language using DNA\n\nCopy/paste the code into the Console, do the examples all run?\n\nEarlier you were told to play around with some code snippets. Perhaps you didn’t fully catch what was going on? If so, try to type in e.g.:\n\nI'm new to R, please explain in simple terms, what the following code does:\n\n\"\nnucleotides <- c(\"a\", \"c\", \"g\", \"t\")\nreplicate(n = 10, expr = paste0(sample(nucleotides, size = 100, replace = TRUE), collapse = \"\"))\n\"\n\n\nSummary\nWhile chatGPT can be a powerful tool for code productivity, it comes with a major caveat: When it fails, it fails with confidence. This means that it will be equally confident whether it is right or wrong! The optimal yield is when you are working on a problem with a tool, where you already have a good knowledge of the problem and the tool. Here, you can see if you are heading in the right direction or if you’re being send on a wild goose chase.\nTherefore, in the beginning of the course, for your own sake, please refrain from using chatGPT!\nInstead solve the exercises based on the materials you have prepared, talk to you group members and discuss the challenges and check your understanding. Then later on, when you have gained initial experience, we can explore using chatGPT to augment your bio data science workflow to enhance productivity"

You are mixing code and text in a Quarto Document! Anything within a “chunk” as defined above will be evaluated as code, whereas anything outside the chunks is markdown. You can use shortcuts to insert new code chunks:\n\nMac: CMD + OPTION + i\nWindows: CTRL + ALT + i\n\nNote, this might not work, depending on your browser. In that case you can insert a new code chunk using  or You can change the shortcuts via “Tools” > “Modify Keyboard shortcuts…” > Filter for “Insert Chunk” and then choose the desired shortcut. E.g. change the shortcut for code chunks to Shift+Cmd+i or similar.\n\nAdd a new code chunk and use the load()-function to load the data you retrieved.\n\n\n\n\nClick here for a hint\n\n\nRemember, you can use ?load to get help on how the function works and remember your project root path is defined by the location of your .Rproj file, i.e. the path. A path is simply where R can find your file, e.g. /home/projects/r_for_bio_data_science/ or similar depending on your particular setup.\n\nNow, in the console, run the ls()-command and confirm, that you did indeed load the gravier data.\n\nRead the information about the gravier-data here\n\nNow, in your Quarto Document, add a new code chunk like so\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n\nThis will load our data science toolbox, including ggplot."

You will likely revisit these basic plots in future exercises.\nPrimer: Plotting 2 x 20 random normally distributed numbers, can be done like so:\n\nggplot(data = tibble(x = rnorm(20),\n                     y = rnorm(20)),\n       mapping = aes(x = x,\n                     y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nUsing this small primer, the materials you read for today and the cancer_data you created, in separate code-chunks, create a:\n\nT1: scatterplot of one variable against another\nT2: linegraph of one variable against another\nT3: boxplot of one variable (Hint: Set x = \"my_gene\" in aes())\nT4: histogram of one variable\nT5: densitogram of one variable\n\nRemember to write notes to yourself, so you know what you did and if there is something in particular you want to remember.\n\nQ4: Do all geoms require both x and y?\n\n\n\nExtending Basic Plots\n\nT6: Pick your favourite gene and create a boxplot of expression levels stratified on the variable event_label\nT7: Like T6, but with densitograms GROUP ASSIGNMENT\nT8: Pick your favourite gene and create a boxplot of expression levels stratified on the variable age_group\n\nThen, add stratification on event_label\nThen, add transparency to the boxes\nThen, add some labels\n\nT9: Pick your favourite gene and create a scatter-plot of expression levels versus age\n\nThen, add stratification on event_label\nThen, add a smoothing line\nThen, add some labels\n\nT10: Pick your favourite two genes and create a scatter-plot of their expression levels\n\nThen, add stratification on event_label\nThen, add a smoothing line\nThen, show split into seperate panes based on the variable age_group\nThen, add some labels\nChange the event_label title of the legend\n\nT11: Recreate the following plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ5: Using your biological knowledge, what is your interpretation of the plot?\nT12: Recreate the following plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ6: Using your biological knowledge, what is your interpretation of the plot?\nT13: If you arrive here and there is still time left for the exercises, you are probably already familiar with ggplot - Use what time is left to challenge yourself to further explore the cancer_data and create some nice data visualisations - Show me what you come up with!"

Because if you use these type of packages, you will be limited to their functionality, whereas if you truly understand ggplot - The sky is the limit! Basically, it the cliché that “If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime”\n\nGetting Started\nUse this link to go to the R for Bio Data Science RStudio Cloud Server\nFirst things first:\n\nCreate a new Quarto Document for todays exercises, e.g. lab04_exercises.qmd\n\nNote that: - The Quarto document MUST be placed together with your .Rproj file (defining, the project root - look in your Files-pane) and also there, the data-folder should be placed!\nUnderstanding how paths and projects work is important. In case this is no entirely clear, a new chapter has been added on Paths and Projects.\n\n\nBrief refresh of Quarto so far\nRecall the syntax for a new code chunk, where all your R code goes any text and notes must be outside the chunk tags:\n\n```{r}\n# Here the code goes\n1 + 1\nx <- c(1, 2, 3)\nmean(x)\n```\n\n[1] 2\n[1] 2\n\n\nOutside the code-chunks, go our markdown, e.g.:\n  # Header level 1\n  ## Header level 2\n  ### Header level 3\n  *A text in italics*\n  **A text in bold**\n  Normal text describing and explaining\nNow, in your new Quarto document, create a new Header level 2, e.g.:\n  ## Load Libraries\nand under your new header, add a new code chunk, like so\n\n```{r}\n#| message: false\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n\nAnd run the chunk. This will load our data science toolbox, including dplyr (and ggplot). But wait, what does the #| message: false-part do? 🤷️ 🤔\nTry to structure your Rmarkdown document as your course notes, i.e. add notes while solving the exercises aiming at creating a revisitable reference for your final project work\nBonus info: We are engineers, so of course, we love equations, we can include standard \\(\\LaTeX\\) syntax, e.g.:\n  $E(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$\nTry it!\n\n\nA few handy short cuts\nInsert new code chunk:\n\nMac: CTRL + OPTION + i\nWindows: CTRL + OPTION + i\n\nRender my Quarto document\n\nMac: CMD + SHIFT + k\nWin: CTRL + SHIFT + k\n\nRun line in chunk\n\nMac: CMD + ENTER\nWin: CTRL + ENTER\n\nRun entire chunk\n\nMac: CMD + SHIFT + ENTER\nWin: CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER\n\nInsert the pipe symbol |>\n\nMac: CMD + SHIFT + m\nWin: CTRL + SHIFT + m\n\nNote, if you’re trying this out and you see %>% instead of |>, then go to Tools, Global Options..., Code and check the box Use native pipeoperator"

But the good news is that that is typical and something that happens to everyone and it’s only temporary! Unfortunately, there is no way to going from knowing nothing about the subject to knowing something about a subject and being an expert in it without going through a period of great frustration and much suckiness!

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nIn the early 20s, the world was hit by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The pandemic was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In Denmark the virus first confirmed case was on 27 February 2020.\nWhile initially very little was known about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we did know the general pathology of vira. Briefly, the virus invades the cells and hijacks the intra-cellular machinery. Using the hijacked machinery, components for new virus particles are produced, eventually being packed into the viral envelope and released from the infected cell. Some of these components, viral proteins, is broken down into smaller fragments called peptides by the proteasome. These peptides are transported into the endoplasmatic reticulum by the Transporter Associated with antigen Processing (TAP) protein complex. Here, they are aided by chaperones bound to the Major Histocompatilibty Complex class I (MHCI) and then across the Golgi Aparatus they finally get displayed on the surface of the cells. Note, in humans, MHC is also called Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) and represents the most diverse genes. Each of us have a total of 6 HLA-alleles, 3 from the maternal and 3 from the paternal side. These are further divided into 3 classes HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C and the combination of these constitute the HLA-haplotype for an individual. Once the peptide is bound to the MHC Class I at the cell surface and exposed, the MHCI-peptide complex can be recognised by CD8+ Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs) via the T-cell Receptor (TCR). If a cell displays peptides of viral origin, the CTL gets activated and via a cascade induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the infected cell. The proces is summarised in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: 10.3389/fmicb.2015.00021\nThe data we will be working with today contains data on sequenced T-cell receptors, viral antigens, HLA-haplotypes and clinical meta data for a cohort:\n\nA large-scale database of T-cell receptor beta (TCR\\(\\beta\\)) sequences and binding associations from natural and synthetic exposure to SARS-CoV-2"

Did any variables “dissappear” and did any “appear”? Ok, so this is a bit tricky, but perhaps there is a function to separate a composit (untidy) column into a set of new variables based on a separator? But what is a separator? Just like when you read a file with Comma Separated Values, a separator denotes how a composite string is divided into fields. So look for such a repeated values, which seem to indeed separate such fields. Also, be aware, that character, which can mean more than one thing, may need to be “escaped” using an initial two backslashed, i.e. “\\x”, where x denotes the character needing to be “escaped”\n\n\nT7: Add a variable, which counts how many peptides are in each observation of Amino Acids\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nWe have been working with the stringr-package, perhaps the contains a function to somehow count the number of occurrences of a given character in a string?

This we can utilise to work with a smaller data set in the development face and once we are ready, we can increase this n gradually to see if everything continues to work as anticipated.\n\nT11: Using the peptide_data, run a few sample_n()-calls with varying degree of n to make sure, that you get a feeling for what is going on\nT12: From the peptide_data data above, with peptide_1, peptide_2, etc. create this data set using one of the data-pivotting functions. Remember to start initially with sampling a smaller data set and then work on that first! Also, once you’re sure you’re good to go, reuse the peptide_data-variable as we don’t want huge redundant data sets floating around in our environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nIf the pivotting is not clear at all, then do what I do, create some example data:\n\nmy_data <- tibble(\n  id = str_c(\"id_\", 1:10),\n  var_1 = round(rnorm(10),1),\n  var_2 = round(rnorm(10),1),\n  var_3 = round(rnorm(10),1))\n\n…and then play around with that. A small set like the one above is easy to handle, so perhaps start with that and then pivot back and forth a few times using the pivot_wider()-/pivot_longer()-functions. Use the View()-function to inspect and get a better overview of the results of pivotting.\n\n\npeptide_data |> \n  sample_n(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 7\n   Experiment CDR3b            V_gene     J_gene    n_peptides peptide_n peptide\n   <chr>      <chr>            <chr>      <chr>          <dbl> <chr>     <chr>  \n 1 eMR13      CASSDRGPNEKLFF   TCRBV27-01 TCRBJ01-…          1 peptide_4 <NA>   \n 2 eOX49      CASSLEGNIQYF     TCRBV07-09 TCRBJ02-…         11 peptide_4 FYLCFL…\n 3 eXL32      CSVATTGVSTDTQYF  TCRBV29-01 TCRBJ02-…         11 peptide_9 MIELSL…\n 4 eOX52      CACRYPDEAFF      TCRBV30-01 TCRBJ01-…          2 peptide_3 <NA>   \n 5 eEE240     CSATDTPEDTQYF    TCRBV20-X  TCRBJ02-…          1 peptide_1 KMQRML…\n 6 eEE226     CASSEPVYGEQYF    TCRBV02-01 TCRBJ02-…          6 peptide_4 LPFNDG…\n 7 eXL31      CSARVYDRMNTEAFF  TCRBV20-X  TCRBJ01-…          2 peptide_6 <NA>   \n 8 eEE224     CSVEDLTGRASYEQYF TCRBV29-01 TCRBJ02-…          4 peptide_… <NA>   \n 9 eXL30      CASSVISGHPNTEAFF TCRBV27-01 TCRBJ01-…         11 peptide_… <NA>   \n10 eEE226     CASSQEPGLGPETQYF TCRBV05-01 TCRBJ02-…         10 peptide_… <NA>   \n\n\n\nQ7: You will see some NAs in the peptide-variable, discuss in your group from where these arise?\nQ8: How many rows and columns now and how does this compare with Q3?

So:\n\nQ13: Discuss in your group, which variable(s?) define the same observations between the peptide_data and the meta_data?\n\nOnce you have agreed upon Experiment, then use that knowledge to subset the meta_data to the variables-of-interest:\n\n\n\n\nmeta_data |> \n  sample_n(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   Experiment Allele      \n   <chr>      <chr>       \n 1 eMR23      \"\"          \n 2 eLH59      \"A*01:01:01\"\n 3 eQD129     \"A*02:01:01\"\n 4 eJL164     \"C*15:02:01\"\n 5 eQD125     \"C*08:01:01\"\n 6 eMR14      \"B*07:02:01\"\n 7 eMR25      \"\"          \n 8 eMR14      \"C*06:02:01\"\n 9 eJL147     \"A*11:01\"   \n10 eMR18      \"A*02:01:01\"\n\n\nUse the View()-function again, to look at the meta_data - Notice something? Some alleles are e.g. A*11:01, whereas others are B*51:01:02. You can find information on why, by visiting Nomenclature for Factors of the HLA System.\nLong story short, we only want to include Field 1 (allele group) and Field 2 (Specific HLA protein). You have prepared the stringr-package for today. See if you can find a way to reduce e.g. B*51:01:02 to B*51:01 and then create a new variable Allele_F_1_2 accordingly, while also removing the ...x (where x is a number) subscripts from the Gene-variable (It is an artifact from having the data in a wide format, where you cannot have two variables with the same name) and also, remove any NAs and \"\"s, denoting empty entries.\n\n\n\nClick here for hint\n\n\nThere are several ways this can be achieved, the easiest being to consider if perhaps a part of the string based on indices could be of interest. This term “a part of a string” is called a substring, perhaps the stringr-package contains a function work with substring? In the console, type stringr:: and hit tab. This will display the functions available in the stringr-package. Scroll down and find the functionst starting with str_ and look for on, which might be relevant and remember you can use ?function_name to get more information on how a given function works.\n\n\n\n\n\nT19: Create the following data, according to specifications above:\n\n\nmeta_data |> \n  sample_n(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   Experiment Allele     Allele_F_1_2\n   <chr>      <chr>      <chr>       \n 1 eOX46      A*02:01    A*02:01     \n 2 eQD136     A*02:01:01 A*02:01     \n 3 eQD124     A*01:01:01 A*01:01     \n 4 eLH53      B*57:01:01 B*57:01     \n 5 eHH175     B*44:03    B*44:03     \n 6 eJL143     B*07:02    B*07:02     \n 7 eJL151     B*15:01:01 B*15:01     \n 8 eJL162     C*03:03:01 C*03:03     \n 9 eLH48      A*24:02:01 A*24:02     \n10 eMR12      A*02:01:01 A*02:01     \n\n\nThe asterix, i.e. * is a rather annoying character because of ambiguity, so:\n\nT20: Clean the data a bit more, by removing the asterix and redundant variables:\n\n\n\n\n\nmeta_data |> \n  sample_n(size = 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   Experiment Allele\n   <chr>      <chr> \n 1 eXL30      A02:01\n 2 eQD128     B39:01\n 3 eLH48      C08:02\n 4 eLH43      C04:09\n 5 eHO124     B44:27\n 6 eMR21      B44:03\n 7 eHO124     C07:04\n 8 eXL31      B44:03\n 9 eLH51      C07:02\n10 eLH48      B14:02\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for hint 1\n\n\nAgain, the stringr-package may come in handy.

And/or perhaps ask your fellow group members if they know?\n\n\n\nCDR3b-sequences binding to pMHC\n\nT24: Subset the peptide_meta_data, such that the length of the CDR3b is 15, the allele is A02:01 and the peptide is LLFLVLIML and re-create the below sequence logo of the CDR3b sequences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ15: In your group, discuss what you see?\nT25: Play around with other combinations of k_CDR3b, Allele, and peptide and inspect how the logo changes\n\nDisclaimer: In this data set, we only get: A given CDR3b was found to recognise a given peptide in a given subject and that subject had a given haplotype - Something’s missing… Perhaps if you have had immunology, then you can spot it? There is a trick to get around this missing information, but that’s beyond scope of what we’re working with here."

    "section": "Modelling",
    "text": "Modelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimer\nFirst, the recent couple of years have seen an immense development in unifying the modelling interface in R, which is notoriously inconsistent. You may be familar with the caret-package, the developer of which has created tidymodels, which I really wish we had time to explore this in details. In the following we will work with some of the principles for tidying model object using broom, having object nested in tibbles and working with these using purrr.\n\n\nGetting started\nFor the data you have so nicely created, the outcome is either 0 or 1, meaning, that we will need a logistic regression to model the data. If you need a refresh on this, then go to this condensed primer, The general model syntax in R is as follows:\n\nmy_data |> \n  glm(y ~ x1 + x2 + ... + xn,\n      data = .,\n      family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n\nWhere y ~ x1 + x2 + ... xn is called a formula and is read like: “Modelling \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x_1\\) plus \\(x_2\\) plus \\(...\\) plus \\(x_n\\)”.\n\n\nFirst steps…\nUsing the data you have created, choose your favourite gene, and make a model of the outcome modelled as a function of that one gene\n\nQ1: What are the coefficients for the intercept and your gene?\n\n\ngravier_data |>\n  glm(outcome ~ g2E09,\n      data = .,\n      family = binomial(link=\"logit\"))\n\n\nQ2: What is the p-value for your gene? Mine is:\n\n\ngravier_data |>\n  glm(outcome ~ g2E09,\n      data = .,\n      family = binomial(link=\"logit\")) |> \n  tidy |>\n  filter(term == \"g2E09\") |> \n  select(term, p.value)\n\n\n\nModels, models everywhere…\nNow, make one model for each of the ! In principle, you could do that, but that would require a lot code and a lot of hard coding. So do not do that for now, but let us instead see if we can come up with something just a tad more clever.\nCreate this long version of your data and save it in gravier_data_long:\n\ngravier_data_long = gravier_data |>\n  pivot_longer(cols = -outcome,\n               names_to = \"gene\",\n               values_to = \"log2_expr_level\")\ngravier_data_long\n\nUsing the group_by()-nest()-ungroup() work-flow, create this nested tibble:\n\ngravier_data_long_nested = gravier_data_long |>\n  group_by(gene) |>\n  nest |> \n  ungroup\ngravier_data_long_nested\n\nNote, this is conceptually a super-tricky data structure, so please do make sure to discuss in your group, what is going on here!\nThen use sample_n() to randomly select 100 genes for further analysis. Remember you may want to use the set.seed() function to create a reproducible random draw\n\nset.seed(934485)\ngravier_data_long_nested = gravier_data_long_nested |>\n  sample_n(100)\ngravier_data_long_nested\n\nNow, we want to fit a logisic regression model to each of the per-gene data sets in the nested tibble. We do this by using mutate(), map() and the “The general model syntax” as defined previously. Remember you are mapping a model to each of the nested data sets, so you will need to include the variable names in your formula and also remember the receipe Hadley mentioned. This is quite tricky initially, so here is a bit of example code, to get you started. Here, we are fitting a standard ordinary least squares linear model on random data:\n\ntibble(x = rnorm(100),\n       y = rnorm(100),\n       g = sample(seq(1, 4),\n                  size = 100,\n                  replace = TRUE)) |>\n  group_by(g) |>\n  nest |>\n  ungroup |>\n  mutate(mu_group = map(data, ~lm(y ~ x, data = .x)))\n\nThink about this and as I have mentioned previously - Copy/paste bits and bops of the code into the console and play around with it until you understand what is going on.\nReturn to your gravier_data_long_nested-dataset and create the below, still saving it into your gravier_data_long_nested and remembering, that we here need a logistic regression\n\ngravier_data_long_nested = gravier_data_long_nested |>\n  mutate(mdl = map(data, ~glm(outcome ~ log2_expr_level,\n                              data = .x,\n                              family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))))\ngravier_data_long_nested\n\nNote, once again, this is conceptually a super-tricky data structure, not only do we have a nested tibble, but now we also have a nested model object - So please do make sure to discuss in your group, what is going on here!\nOk, now we have model for each of our 100 genes. Let us use the broom-package to extract some information from each of the models\nHint: broom has a very useful function, which helps “cleaning up” model objects. Also, you may want to include conf.int = TRUE in your map()-call\n\ngravier_data_long_nested = gravier_data_long_nested |>\n  mutate(mdl_tidy = map(mdl, tidy, conf.int = TRUE)) |> # OR map(mdl, ~tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE))\n  unnest(mdl_tidy)\ngravier_data_long_nested\n\nNow, we are only interested in the terms for the genes, so remove the (Intercept)-rows:\nHint: Check, that your dimensions should go from 200 to 100, corresponding to the 100 random genes you selected for further analysis!\n\ngravier_data_long_nested = gravier_data_long_nested |> \n  filter(str_detect(term, \"log2\"))\ngravier_data_long_nested\n\nAdd an indicator variable, denoing if a given term for a given gene is significant i.e. \\(p < 0.05\\)\n\ngravier_data_long_nested = gravier_data_long_nested |> \n  mutate(identified_as = case_when(p.value < 0.05 ~ \"Significant\",\n                                   TRUE ~ \"Non-significant\"))\ngravier_data_long_nested\n\n\n\nVisualise Associations\nA Useful way of illustrating p-values for gene association is the so-called Manhattan-plot. For this we need to calculate the negative log10 of the p-values, so do that like so:\n\ngravier_data_long_nested = gravier_data_long_nested |> \n  mutate(neg_log10_p = -log10(p.value))\ngravier_data_long_nested\n\nNow, using your data visualisations skills, re-create this Manhattan-plot:\n\ngravier_data_long_nested |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(gene, desc(neg_log10_p)),\n             y = neg_log10_p,\n             colour = identified_as)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05),\n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  theme_classic(base_family = \"Avenir\", base_size = 8) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(x = \"Gene\", y = \"Minus log10(p)\")\n\nCongratulations! You have just done a what is equivalent of a GWAS! However, a more interesting visualisation is a confidence interval plot with effect directions, so let us create that and by us, I mean you\n\ngravier_data_long_nested |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate,\n             y = fct_reorder(gene, desc(estimate)),\n             colour = identified_as)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high, height = 0.2)) +\n  theme_classic(base_family = \"Avenir\", base_size = 8) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(y = \"\",\n       title = \"\",\n       caption = \"The 111 patients with no event after diagnosis were labelled good (0), and the 57 patients with early metastasis were labelled poor (1).\") \n\nIn the first plot, we coloured by whether or not a give gene had as signficant association - Notice something about how this colour maps to the this plot?\nNow, do the same plot, but now only including genes with a significant association:\n\ngravier_data_long_nested |> \n  filter(identified_as == \"Significant\") |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate,\n             y = fct_reorder(gene, desc(estimate)))) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high, height = 0.2)) +\n  theme_classic(base_family = \"Avenir\", base_size = 12) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(y = \"\",\n       title = \"\",\n       caption = \"The 111 patients with no event after diagnosis were labelled good (0), and the 57 patients with early metastasis were labelled poor (1).\") \n\nNote, we have not taken multiple testing into account. If you have the time, you could redo the above with adjust p-values. See ?p.adjust"

    "text": "Exercises\nRead the steps of this exercises carefully while completing them\n\nIntroduction\nThe aim of these exercises is to set up a collaborative coding project using GitHub and collaborate on creating a simple R package that replicates the central dogma of molecular biology.\nThe exercises uses what you learned in Lab 7 and its exercises. But don’t worry too much, the setup steps will be given here as well.\n\n\n\nHow to work with an R package\nThere are a few things to know when creating a package before you jump in. These are not strict rules, but they make your life easier when bug-fixing and make the package much easier to use for the users. To learn about those, click the foldout sections in the following topics. If you feel confident in the realm of R packages, feel free to skip ahead, but don’t leave your group too far behind.\n\nDependencies\n\n\nThe one strict rule is Never use library(“package”) within a package! \n\nInstead, add the packages your are going to use to the DESCRIPTION file and in the function descriptions. This is done by running usethis::use_package(\"packageName\") in the console and adding @import package (OK) or @importFrom package function1 function2 ... (Best). Using the functions in your package is then done with package::function() (e.g., dplyr::mutate()) or omitting the package::.\nThis way, it is easy to read what functions are from your package, and your package namespace does not get cluttered. Read more in the Namespace section.\nIt should also be a goal to make your package depend on as few other packages as possible. The user will need to install all packages your package depends on, but then also every package those depends on - that list quickly become quite long if you are not careful.\n\n\n\nFunctions\n\n\nA package is typically a collections of functions.\n\nThese functions are stored in .R files in the R folder. A good starting point is to create an .R file for each function. But, as the package becomes bigger, it often makes sense to combine related functions into bigger files.\nYou can quickly create a new .R file with usethis::use_r(\"function_name\"). Or do it manually, as you are used to.\n\n\n\nDocumenting functions\nTry running ?mean in the Console.\n\n\nIf you have every wondered how to write a manual like the one that pops up, please click here and read - if not, consider reading it anyway, as you will use it later.\n\nWhen you have made a function, or have at least defined one, you should describe what it does and how to use it. The manual you write for your function is the function documentation, and it should describe the purpose of the function and how to use it.\nYou can read extensively about it here, but I will give you the most essential information to get you started.\nThe R package roxygen2 makes this easy as 1-2-3. It is part of devtools and is already installed. It uses #' comments above the function. @ tags lets you add specific details to the function documentation.\nCreate an roxygen skeleton by clicking somewhere in your function. Go to the ‘Code’ tab in the top of your window and select ‘Insert Roxygen Skeleton’.\nThis will look something like this:\n\n#' Title\n#'\n#' @param foo \n#' @param bar \n#'\n#' @return\n#' @export\n#'\n#' @examples\nmyFunction <- function(foo, bar){\n  # Do stuff with foo and bar\n  foobar <- (foo * bar) / (foo + bar)\n  return(foobar)\n}\n\nThis allows you to add the most basic descriptions. To begin with, the Title, @param, and @export are the most important, you may remove the other tags for now. A more detailed example is given here. There, you can also read about documenting datasets and other object types - even the package itself.\n\n\n\nNamespace\n\n\nYour package namespace can quickly become very cluttered, if you are not careful.\n\nTherefore, follow these rules:\n\nOnly @export the functions the users will use. Removing the tag makes the function internal and hides it from your package namespace. It can still be freely used within your package and accessed outside your package with package:::internal_function()\nMake your code explicit with package::function().\n\nThis step is not mandatory, but makes reading the code easier.\n\nAdd your dependencies in the DESCRIPTION file with usethis::use_package(\"packageName\")\nOnly very rarely use the @import tag. Aim to use the @importFrom tags in your function descriptions instead.\n\nYou can read more extensively about namespace here.\n\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nTesting is essential\n\nto ensure your package runs smoothly and that no bugs are introduced when you make a seemingly minor change. It is handled with the testthat package, which is also installed with devtools.\nI will not go into too much detail here, but know that testing is an important, but often neglected, part of building a package. You can read more about it here.\nEvery time you run the usethis::use_r() function to create a new script, the function encourages you to create a test alongside the new function. I recommend you follow that advise.\nYou create a test by running usethis::use_test(\"function name\").\nThe function creates a new folder tests and creates a test script for the function. The good R package creator writes a few tests for every function.\nThe exercises will ask you to make a simple test for every function, introducing you to the concept.\n\n\n\nThe Package Workflow\nWhen creating a package, it is important to test your work along the way.\n\n\nYou can do that in many ways, but I recommend the following workflow:\n\n\nWrite a function / make a change\n\nIf it is a new function, document it\n\nSave your files: rstudioapi::documentSaveAll()\nCreate package documentation: devtools::document()\nLoad package: devtools::load_all()\nYour package is now loaded, and you can test that it works as intended.\n\nOptionally, you can save the three lines of code in dev/load.R and run the lines with source(\"dev/load.R\"). If you do, add the dev folder to the .Rbuildignore file.\n\n\n\n\n\nTASKS\nNow you know the basics of creating a package. And you are ready to begin.\n\nTask 1 - Setting up the R package\nIn the first task, one team member (you decide who) will initiate a package project and push it to Github. Then, when instructed, the remaining group members will connect to that repository, and the real package building will begin.\n\nTask 1.1 - Create R Package\n\nGo to R for Bio Data Science RStudio Cloud Server and login.\nClick Create a project in the top left and choose New Directory.\nSelect R Package and pick a fitting Package name.\n\nThe package you will create will replicate the central dogma of molecular biology. Let that inspire you\nLook up naming rules here\nThe most important rule: _, -, and ' are not allowed.\n\nClick “Create project”.\n\nRStudio will now create an R project for you that contains all necessary files and folders.\n\nOpen the DESCRIPTION file and write a title for your package, a small description, and add authors.\n\n\nWhen adding authors, the format is:\n\n\nAuthor@R:\n  c(person(given = \"firstname\",\n           family = \"lastname\",\n           role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"), # There must be a \"cre\", but there can only be one\n           email = \"your@email.com\"), \n    person(given = \"firstname\",\n           family = \"lastname\",\n           role = \"aut\",\n           email = \"your@email.com\"))\n\n\nCreate an MIT license usethis::use_mit_license(\"Group name\")\n\n\nOptional setup steps (generally good, but not essential for this course)\n\n\n\nIf the “Git” tab is not in the lower left panel:\n\n\n\nRun usethis::use_git() and reopen the project to have it appear\n\n\nTo use GitHub, you create an empty repository there and link the account with gert::git_remote_add(\"link\") and gert::git_push(\"origin\")\n\n\ngit push will now push your committed changes to the GitHub repository\n\n\n\nAdd a lifecycle badge: usethis::use_lifecycle_badge( \"Experimental\" )\n\n\nWrite vignettes: usethis::use_vignette(\"Vignette name\")\n\n\nAdd a Readme file usethis::use_readme_rmd( open = FALSE ). You will do that in the Group Assignment later\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 1.2 - Setup GitHub Repository for your group’s R package\nStill only the first team member\n\nGo to https://github.com/rforbiodatascience22\nClick the green New-button\nCreate a new repository called group_X_package. Remember to replace the X\nSelect rforbiodatascience22 as owner\nMake the repository Public\nClick the green Create repository-button\nIn this new repository, click the settings tab\nClick Collaborators and Team\nClick the green Add people-button\nInvite the remaining group members\nAll other team members should now have access to the repository, but do not create your own project yet.\n\n\n\nTask 1.3 - Connect your RStudio Server Project to the GitHub Repository\nStill only the first team member\n\nFind your PAT key or create a new\n\n\nHow to create a new one\n\n\n\nType in the console usethis::create_github_token(). You’re going to be redirected to GitHub website.\n\nIn case you did that step manually, remember to give permission to access your repositories.\n\nYou need to type your password. Don’t change the default settings of creating the token except for the description – set ‘RStudio Cloud’ or something similar. Then hit Generate token.\n\nCopy the generated token (should start with ghp_) and store it securely (e.g., in a password manager). Do not keep it in a plain file.\n\n\nGo back to the RStudio Server project\nType in the console gitcreds::gitcreds_set() and paste the PAT key\nStage all files (in the git window in the top right) by ticking all boxes under Staged\nStill in the console, run the following commands. Replace your group number and use your GitHub username and email. You run these to link your project to the GitHub repository you created. Remember to replace the X.\n\n\nusethis::use_git_remote(name = \"origin\", \"https://github.com/rforbiodatascience22/group_X_package.git\", overwrite = TRUE)\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"USERNAME\", user.email = \"USEREMAIL@EXAMPLE.ORG\")\ngert::git_commit_all(\"Package setup\")\ngert::git_push(\"origin\")\n\nAll other team members\nAfter your teammate has pushed to GitHub.\n\nIn the RStudio Server, create a new project based on the GitHub Repository just created by your teammate.\n\nClick Create a project in the top left.\nChoose Version Control and then Git.\nPaste in the repository URL: \"https://github.com/rforbiodatascience22/group_X_package.git\". Remember to replace the X.\nGive the directory a fitting name and click Create Project.\n\nFind your PAT key or create a new\n\n\nHow to create a new one\n\n\n\nType in the console usethis::create_github_token(). You’re going to be redirected to GitHub website.\n\nIn case you did it manually, remember to give permission to access your repositories.\n\nYou need to type your password. Don’t change the default settings of creating the token except for the description – set ‘RStudio Cloud’ or something similar. Then hit Generate token.\n\nCopy the generated token (should start with ghp_) and store it securely (e.g. in password manager). Do not keep it in a plain file.\n\n\nGo back to the RStudio Server project\nType in the console gitcreds::gitcreds_set() and paste the PAT key\nStill in the console, run the following commands. Replace your GitHub username and email.\n\n\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"USERNAME\", user.email = \"USEREMAIL@EXAMPLE.ORG\")\n\nIf RStudio at any point asks you to log in to GitHub, redo step 4 and 5.\nNow you are ready to work on the R package.\n\n\n\nTask 2 - Build the package\n\nEach team member should build and implement their own function. The code will be given, but you will be asked to come up with a name for your function and many of the variables, so discuss in the team what naming convention you want to use. Do you want to use snake_case (common in tidyverse) or camelCase (common in Bioconductor)? It doesn’t really matter, but try to be consistent.\n\n\nTask 2.1 - Incorporate data\nIn this task you will include the following codon table in your package.\nThis task should be done by one team member. The rest should follow along.\n\nBelow is a standard codon table. Store it in an object with a name of your own choosing.\n\n\nc(\"UUU\" = \"F\", \"UCU\" = \"S\", \"UAU\" = \"Y\", \"UGU\" = \"C\",\n  \"UUC\" = \"F\", \"UCC\" = \"S\", \"UAC\" = \"Y\", \"UGC\" = \"C\",\n  \"UUA\" = \"L\", \"UCA\" = \"S\", \"UAA\" = \"_\", \"UGA\" = \"_\",\n  \"UUG\" = \"L\", \"UCG\" = \"S\", \"UAG\" = \"_\", \"UGG\" = \"W\",\n  \"CUU\" = \"L\", \"CCU\" = \"P\", \"CAU\" = \"H\", \"CGU\" = \"R\",\n  \"CUC\" = \"L\", \"CCC\" = \"P\", \"CAC\" = \"H\", \"CGC\" = \"R\",\n  \"CUA\" = \"L\", \"CCA\" = \"P\", \"CAA\" = \"Q\", \"CGA\" = \"R\",\n  \"CUG\" = \"L\", \"CCG\" = \"P\", \"CAG\" = \"Q\", \"CGG\" = \"R\",\n  \"AUU\" = \"I\", \"ACU\" = \"T\", \"AAU\" = \"N\", \"AGU\" = \"S\",\n  \"AUC\" = \"I\", \"ACC\" = \"T\", \"AAC\" = \"N\", \"AGC\" = \"S\",\n  \"AUA\" = \"I\", \"ACA\" = \"T\", \"AAA\" = \"K\", \"AGA\" = \"R\",\n  \"AUG\" = \"M\", \"ACG\" = \"T\", \"AAG\" = \"K\", \"AGG\" = \"R\",\n  \"GUU\" = \"V\", \"GCU\" = \"A\", \"GAU\" = \"D\", \"GGU\" = \"G\",\n  \"GUC\" = \"V\", \"GCC\" = \"A\", \"GAC\" = \"D\", \"GGC\" = \"G\",\n  \"GUA\" = \"V\", \"GCA\" = \"A\", \"GAA\" = \"E\", \"GGA\" = \"G\",\n  \"GUG\" = \"V\", \"GCG\" = \"A\", \"GAG\" = \"E\", \"GGG\" = \"G\")\n\n\nRun usethis::use_data(name_of_object, overwrite = TRUE, internal = TRUE)\nYou have now made the data available to our functions, but we also want to make it visible for our users.\n\nRun usethis::use_data(name_of_object, overwrite = TRUE).\n\nWrite a data manual (document the data).\n\nAll non-internal data should be documented in a data.R file in the R folder. Create it with usethis::use_r(\"data\")\nAdd the following scaffold and write a very brief description of the data (see an example here). Don’t spend a lot of time here.\n\n\n\n#' Title\n#' \n#' Description\n#' \n#' \n#' @source \\url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi?chapter=tgencodes#SG1}\n\"name_of_object\"\n\nNormally, you should also describe how the raw data was cleaned. You would do that in the file that opens after running usethis::use_data_raw( name = \"name_of_object\", open = TRUE ), but that is less relevant here, so we will skip that part.\nYour package now includes some data.\nRestart R, clean your Environment (small broom in the Environment tab), run the three lines of code from The Package Workflow section, and run ?name_of_object. Your manual should pop up. Try printing the object as well to see what it looks like print(name_of_object).\nPush your changes to GitHub. The other team members pull the changes to have the data available to you as well.\n\n\n\nTask 2.2 - Implement functions\nIn this task you will be working individually to implement a function each. If you are fewer in the team than the number of functions. The quickest to finish can implement the remaining, or separate them out as you see fit.\nIf you want an additional challenge, each team member can create their own Git branch gert::git_branch_checkout(\"branch_name\") and work there. When done, merge your branch with the main branch. That is a more clean and ‘proper’ workflow, but completely optional.\nIf you are in doubt what the underlying functions do, run ?function_name to get a hint about their purpose. Also, remember the functions are replicating the central dogma. Let that inspire you, when naming the functions and variables. If you get stuck, ask your teammates about their functions.\nFunction five is a bit more involved. Do it together or help your teammate out if it causes problems.\nFor each function, complete the following steps:\n\nLook carefully at your function. Choose a fitting name for it\nRun usethis::use_r(\"function_name\") to create an .R file for the function\nPaste in the function and rename all places it says name_me with fitting names\nClick somewhere in the function. In the toolbar at the very top of the page, choose Code and click Insert Roxygen Skeleton\nFill out the function documentation\n\nGive the function a title\nDo not write anything after @export\nThe parameters should have the format: @param param_name description of parameter\nThe return has the format: @return description of function output\nExamples can span multiple lines and what you write will be run.\nImportant! Either fill out everything or delete what you don’t describe. Otherwise, the package check will fail (Do not delete @export for these functions).\n\nRun the three lines of codes from The Package Workflow section\n\n\nrstudioapi::documentSaveAll()  # Saves all you files\ndevtools::document()  # Writes all your manuals for you\ndevtools::load_all()  # Simulates library(\"your package\"), allowing you to use your functions\n\n\nView your function documentation with ?function_name\nDefining a test or a series of tests around your newly created function ensures future corrections will not yield undesired results. Create such a test for your function. Run usethis::use_test(\"function_name\") and write a test. Draw some inspiration from here or from running ?testthat::expect_equal.\n\nSkip this step for function five. Instead, write inline code comments for each chunk of code. Press Cmd+Shift+c / Ctrl+Shift+C to comment your currently selected line.\n\nRerun the three lines from The Package Workflow section and check that the package works with devtools::check()\n\n\n\nBriefly about check\n\ndevtools::check() will check every aspect of your package and run the tests you created. You will likely get some warnings or notes like ‘No visible binding for global variables’. They are often harmless, but, if you like, you can get rid of them as described here. The check will tell you what might cause problems with your package and often also how to fix it. If there are any errors, fix those. Warnings and notes are also good to address. Feel free to do that if any pops up.\n\n\nIf it succeeds without errors, push your changes to GitHub\n\nUse the RStudio GUI if you prefer\nRemember to pull first\nIf you chose to create your own branch, merge it with master/main.\n\n\n\n\nFunction one\n\n\nname_me1 <- function(name_me2){\n  name_me3 <- sample(c(\"A\", \"T\", \"G\", \"C\"), size = name_me2, replace = TRUE)\n  name_me4 <- paste0(name_me3, collapse = \"\")\n  return(name_me4)\n}\n\n\n\n\nFunction two\n\n\nname_me1 <- function(name_me2){\n  name_me3 <- gsub(\"T\", \"U\", name_me2)\n  return(name_me3)\n}\n\n\n\n\nFunction three\n\n\nname_me1 <- function(name_me2, start = 1){\n  name_me3 <- nchar(name_me2)\n  codons <- substring(name_me2,\n                      first = seq(from = start, to = name_me3-3+1, by = 3),\n                      last = seq(from = 3+start-1, to = name_me3, by = 3))\n  return(codons)\n}\n\n\n\n\nFunction four\n\nname_of_your_object refers to the codon table you stored in Task 2.\n\nname_me <- function(codons){\n  name_me2 <- paste0(name_of_your_object[codons], collapse = \"\")\n  return(name_me2)\n}\n\n\n\n\nFunction five\n\nThis function will be the first to use dependencies. As a reminder, a dependency is a package that your package depends on. In this case, it will be magrittr, stringr, and ggplot2. They are already installed, so you don’t need to do that. The best way to add these packages to your own is to first add them to your package dependencies with usethis::use_package(\"package_name\"). Do that with all three.\nFor magrittr it is a good idea to add the Tidyverse pipe %>% to your package namespace. When writing your function documentation, add a line with @importFrom magrittr %>%. For the ggplot2 functions, we will use ggplot2::function_name everywhere a ggplot2 function is used. Also add @import ggplot2 to the function description. The same applies for stringr, but since we only use a few functions, add @importFrom stringr str_split boundary str_count to the function description.\n\nname_me1 <- function(name_me2){\n  name_me3 <- name_me2 |>  \n    stringr::str_split(pattern = stringr::boundary(\"character\"), simplify = TRUE) %>%\n    as.character() |> \n    unique()\n  \n  counts <- sapply(name_me3, function(amino_acid) stringr::str_count(string = name_me2, pattern =  amino_acid)) |>  \n    as.data.frame()\n  \n  colnames(counts) <- c(\"Counts\")\n  counts[[\"Name_me2\"]] <- rownames(counts)\n  \n  name_me4 <- counts |>  \n    ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = Name_me2, y = Counts, fill = Name_me2)) +\n    ggplot2::geom_col() +\n    ggplot2::theme_bw() +\n    ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n  \n  return(name_me4)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3 - Group discussion\n\nDescribe each function to each other in order - both what it does and which names you gave them and their variables.\nThe person(s) responsible for function five, describe how you added the three packages as dependencies and included the pipe in the package namespace.\nDiscuss why it is a good idea to limit the number of dependencies your package has. When can’t it be avoided?\nDiscuss the difference between adding an @importFrom package function tag to a function description compared to using package::function(). Read this section if you are not sure or just want to learn more.\n\n\n\n\nGROUP ASSIGNMENT\n\nFor this week’s group assignment, write a vignette (user guide) for your package (max 2 pages). The vignette should include a brief description of what the package is about and demonstrate how each function in the package is used (individually and in conjunction with each other). As a final section, discuss use cases for the package and what other functions could be included. Also include the main points from your discussion in Task 3.\nInclude a link to your group’s GitHub repository at the top of the vignette. Hand it in as a pdf in DTU Learn, as you did the previous weeks.\n\nCreate a vignette with usethis::use_vignette(\"package name\").\nWhen you are done writing it, run devtools::build_vignettes().\nAt the top line of your vignette, change rmarkdown::html_vignette to rmarkdown::pdf_document\nRerun devtools::build_vignettes() - the created pdf-file in the doc-folder is the document to hand it.\nLastly, duplicate the vignette as the GitHub README\n\nCreate a README with usethis::use_readme_rmd( open = TRUE ).\nCopy the content of the vignette Rmarkdown into the readme Keep the top part of the README as is. If you overwrote it anyway, change rmarkdown::pdf_document to rmarkdown::github_document.\nRun devtools::build_readme()\nPush the changes to GitHub\n\n\n\n\nLast tip on packages\n\nNext week, I will introduce the golem package for building production-grade Shiny apps. However, I personally also use it to quickly get going with packages.\nWhen starting out with an R package, it may seem complicated with a lot of things to remember. golem remembers these things for you. When setting up your package / Shiny app with golem::create_golem(\"Your awesome package/app name\"), it creates a dev folder with a few files listing all you need to get started with an R package.\nIt does also give you a lot of other things that you will rarely use, and it also sets up some basic structures for Shiny apps. These can simply be deleted if you are not also building a Shiny app."

This should result in:\n\nNote here how we now have  data and  r_for_bio_data_science.Rproj. These are different, one is a folder, data, and the other is a file, r_for_bio_data_science.Rproj, containing settings for your RStudio Project.\nLet us try to put som data into the data-folder. In the console window, run the following command\n\nwrite.table(x = datasets::Puromycin, file = \"data/puromycin.tsv\", sep = \"\\t\")\n\nThis should look like so:\n\nThis command write a table containing the Puromycin from an R-package named datasets, this is done using the x-parameter. The next paramter is file and we set that to indicate, that the file should go into the data-folder we created and that we would like the file to be named puromycin.tsv, where tsv is an abbreviation for tab-separated-values and then the last parameter sep is set to \"\\t\" indicating, that we want the values to be separated by a tab, as indicated, when we named the file.\nOnce you have run the command, click the data-folder and you should now see:\n\nAgain, click .., this will take you one level up, so you again see:\n\nNow, we have a data file called puromycin.tsv. Let us read that file into R. We can do that like so:\n\nmy_data <- read.table(file = \"puromycin.tsv\")\n\nEnter the command into the console and run it like we did before. You will now see the following:\n\nSo, what happend? The blue writing is your command and the red is an error message from R. Always read error messages carefully, they will inform you what went wrong. In this case, we can see that cannot open file 'puromycin.tsv': No such file or directory.\nThis happened because we forgot to specify where the puromycin.tsv-file is located. R is very picky here, you have to specify exactly where R should find things. Recall, that we decided to create a data-folder and that we placed the puromycin.tsv-file into that folder. This we have to specify, when we use the file parameter in the read.table()-function. So, let us fix that:\n\nmy_data <- read.table(file = \"data/puromycin.tsv\")\n\nThis data/puromycin.tsv is the path to the file and now, that we have got that correct, you will see no error message and furthermore, you will see in the environment-pane, that we now have an object called my_data, containing 23 obs. of 3 varibles, i.e. a data set with 23 rows and 3 columns."

    "text": "Absolute versus Relative Paths\nLet us get back to why we have to work using RStudio Projects, recall we created the r_for_bio_data_science.Rproj-file, defining out project. You can verify, that we are indeed working in that project, by looking in the upper right corner of the RStudio IDE and you should see  r_for_bio_data_science.\nGood, now in the console, enter the command:\n\ngetwd()\n\nYou should see something along the lines of:\n\n\"/net/pupilx/home/people/student_id/projects/r_for_bio_data_science\"\n\nSo, when we read the puromycin.tsv-file using the path data/puromycin.tsv, we specify, that R should look for the file puromycin.tsv in the data folder. So why did we not have to specify /net/pupilx/home/people/student_id/projects/r_for_bio_data_science? Well indeed, we could have specified the full location of the puromycin.tsv-file, which would be:\n\n\"/net/pupilx/home/people/student_id/projects/r_for_bio_data_science/data/puromycin.tsv\"\n\nThis is called the absolute path and here you should note, that it begins with a /. But let us say, that we had indeed in our code stated:\n\nmy_data <- read.table(file = \"/net/pupilx/home/people/student_id/projects/r_for_bio_data_science/data/puromycin.tsv\")\n\nThen that would work… On OUR computer. If we were to share our code to a colleague or a collaborator, then that would not work, because that person would have a different path, e.g. a different student_id. The code would break! Imagine that you have thousands of line of code with hundreds of absolute paths - You would spend hours-and-hours on fixing all the absolute paths, so they matched that particular computer. Then every time we would want to share the analysis project, we would have to redo this tedious proces!\nThis is why we work in RStudio Projects! RStudio Projects allows us to specifiy where everything is located relative to where the .Rproj-file is. So in our case, the r_for_bio_data_science.Rproj-file is located in the same place as the data-folder, namely in the folder containing our entire project, the r_for_bio_data_science-folder, which in turn is located in the projects-folder.\nThis means, that all paths in the analysis project, can be stated relative to the location of the .Rproj-file and hence we have relative paths, meaning that anyone can receive the project and run it straight-out-of-the-box!"

Let’s verify, that we did indeed update the my_dna_data:\n\n\nmy_dna_data\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   sequence              dna_length\n   <chr>                      <int>\n 1 aggtgtgag                      9\n 2 tggaatgaaccgcctacc            18\n 3 aagaatgga                      9\n 4 tct                            3\n 5 tgtatt                         6\n 6 tgg                            3\n 7 accttcaacgagtcccactgt         21\n 8 cgt                            3\n 9 gaggctgagctggttgta            18\n10 ggggaacag                      9\n\n\nDid it make sense?

This facilitates lower maintanence on code. Imagine the case, where you are perhaps 10 bio data scientists working on e.g. an R-package, which will used downstream by another department. You really need to make sure, that everything is top notch, so you decide to do code reviewing. You write your code up and then your colleague will go over the code to check it. But you and your colleague have completely different opinions on how the code should be styled. This will result in an unnecessary time overhead. Another case, could be a colleague leaving for another position, where you then have to take over that colleague’s code base and you end up re-styling the code, so it matches your preferences, again this will increase maintenance unnecessarily. The solution is to agree on a set of rules and principles on how to style your code - This is code styling!\nBelow follows the code styling you will have to adhere to in this course"

    "text": "So, how should we style the code?\nIn this course, we will use principles from the The tidyverse style guide. At first, it may seem constraining, but you will quickly get used to it and then it will be easier moving forward. Note, for your project, being able to review consistant code, will save you valuable time!\nRecall the cancer_data (gravier) dataset, we worked with:\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(\"curl\")\nbase_url <- \"https://github.com/\"\ntarget_file <- \"ramhiser/datamicroarray/raw/master/data/gravier.RData\"\noutput_file <- \"data/gravier.RData\"\ncurl_download(url = str_c(base_url,\n                          target_file),\n              destfile = output_file)\n\nPrinciples:\n\nQuote the packages you load using the library-function\nUse the proper variable assignment in R, namely <-\nStay within 80 characters width. Note, you can set a “help line”: Tools \\(\\rightarrow\\) Global Options... \\(\\rightarrow\\) Code \\(\\rightarrow\\) Display \\(\\rightarrow\\) Show margin \\(\\rightarrow\\) Margin column: 80\nUse double quotes. This is for consistency with other languages\nTab out parameters of functions\nDo line breaks after commas\nDo one space on each side of =, when assigning arguments to parameters, e.g. my_function(parameter_1 = argument_1), etc.\nMatch indentations, this RStudio will do for you in most cases\n\nOk, a bit of data wrangling:\n\nload(file = \"data/gravier.RData\")\ncancer_data <- gravier |> \n  bind_cols() |> \n  rename(early_metastasis = y) |> \n  mutate(pt_id = str_c(\"pt_\", row_number()),\n         pt_has_early_metastasis = case_when(\n    early_metastasis == \"good\" ~ \"No\",\n    early_metastasis == \"poor\" ~ \"Yes\"))\n\nPrinciples:\n\nLine break after each pipe |>, recall we prononuce the pipe as “then”\nLine break after commas inside functions, such as here with mutate()\nIf the line in mutate() becomes wide, then consider using a single linebreak after opening the function call\nuse proper descriptive variable names in snake case like pt_has_early_metastasis, there is no overhead in understanding what this variable means\n\nLet’s do a simple plot:\n\ncancer_data |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = early_metastasis,\n             y = g8A08)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0,\n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-0.5, 0.5)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Early Metastasis\")\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples:\n\nLinebreak after +, just like with the pipe\nSpace after comma inside a vector, like when we define the limits\n\nDo it - It’ll be fun and it does not take a long time to adapt!"

Rethink the question: Discuss in your group what are your interests and then find data related to your problem, there are literally terabytes of publicly available data, i.e. don’t just google “data”, be specific\nIn order for you to demonstrate that you master the entire bio data science cycle, you must choose a bio data set, which requires cleaning and tidying\nIt would be good, if the data set requires joining, if not, consider artificially splitting it, to demonstrate that you master joining\nOne approach could be to work on reproducing results from a paper. Here, you can even consider improving the data visualisations or adding something extra\nDo not use a data set from one of the course exercises. Doing so would not allow you to demonstrate that you are independently capable of performing a bio data science analysis\nYou are 100% free to choose bio data from any resource as long as it meets the above requirements\n\n\n\n\n\nDepends, does your data set come with a readme, which allows you to make a decision regarding NAs?\nBe careful not to simply drop all NAs as you might drop observations, where columns of interest have complete data\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case your variable contains categories, i.e. values, where the question “Is one larger than the other” is nonsensical, then encode as factors\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you believe the data points are nonsensical, e.g. manual typing errors, then exclude them, but be very clear about which data (groups of) points were excluded and why\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, if you are particularly interested in a subset of the data, then that is perfectly fine. Just be aware, that any choice you take with the data, you must be able to account for why you took that choice\nYou should NOT just sample 100 observations as was done in the exercises to reduce runtime. However, if your data set is large, consider down-sampling either randomly or by some metric of association. For the latter e.g. perform a test and identify the top X observations, save those to file and continue from there.\nFor large data, try appending “.gz” to your files, when you write them using write_tsv(), this will invoke gzip-compression"

    "text": "Coding\n\nWhat goes in the “augment” script?\n\nIf you google “Augment“, you will get “make (something) greater by adding to it; increase”, in other words, when you add e.g. variables to your data, which was not there initially, e.g. like we did, when we calculated the BMI from existing information on weight and height\nYou should think of the augment script as the place, where you create your database for everything that happens afterwards, i.e. all your analyses and ideas\nCreate that “database” and then load it into your downstream scripts\nAugment == Adding something\n\n\n\nCan we mix base R and tidyverse?\n\nNo, you might as well get used to it - Tidyverse all the way! (This is a tidyverse course)\n\n\n\nWhat if we can’t make it work in tidyverse but only in base R?\n\nIf you can make it work in base R, you can make it work in tidyverse\n\n\n\nIs it okay to use e.g. the base function sum()?\n\nYes, think of it this way: R has as core functionality to do statistics. Tidyverse is for performing the data manipulation surrounding these calculations. Therefore, using functions such as sum(), mean(), sd(), etc. is naturally fine\n\n\n\nHow do we know if there is a tidyverse function we should use rather than base?\n\nIdentify the general area of what you’re working with. E.g. if strings, then go to your RStudio session and find the console and type “stringr::” and hit tab, then you can look through the functions\nLook in the R-for-Data-Science book https://r4ds.had.co.nz\nAsk on the community pages https://community.rstudio.com\n\n\n\nCan we use package X for analysis/visualisation?\n\nIf the package performs a lot of the work, which you are to demonstrate that you can do, then no. Do not use packages, where you call a plot-my-data-function and the ggplot-magick happens that will not allow you to demonstrate that you have met the course learning objectives\n\n\n\nHow do we run the entire project incl. the presentation?\n\nMake sure to include a programmatic call to knitr at the end of your doit-script\n\n\n\nShould we create a Shiny app?\n\nThe project deliverables are the GitHub repo and your presentation. Remember, you do this project not for me as a teacher, but for you to internalize the knowledge you have been exposed to during the initial 10 weeks of teaching. If you find Shiny interesting/fun, then by all means, please do create an app. Shiny apps are optional\n\n\n\nShould we create a package?\n\nOptional, if you do, be careful with your time usage. You should focus on the data science cycle\n\n\n\nWhen should we create functions?\n\nRemember DRY (Dont-Repeat-Yourself), so generally, if you do something more than once, it is a function. However, we do not focus much on functions in this course, so don’t put too much effort into creating functions\nPlace functions in 99_proj_functions.R as illustrated in the overview\nDO NOT hide your code away in functions, so that your main script just becomes 10 function calls. For this process-oriented course, show the code in your main scripts, i.e. 01_, 02_, …\n\n\n\nCan we use loops?\n\nNo, you should instead embrace functional programming and use functions from the “purrr”-package. Revisit lab 6, if needed\n\n\n\nCan we directly copy/paste a code chunk from an online source?\n\nNo, that would be plagiarism. Understand the steps in the chunk and make the code your own\nI acknowledge that for coding this is not completely black and white, but please refrain from a direct copy/paste Coding style\n\n\n\nHow should we comment on our code?\n\nRemember, the point of writing verbose tidyverse code is that the code-becomes-the-comments. Think of it this way: The pipeline is the text on a page in a book, so before your pipeline, put a header/title on what is happening below, just as a title/header in a book\nThe title/header will be what is generally going on, e.g. “Normalise all gene expression values using standard score approach” and the pipeline will be how that is actually done\nThe pipe “%>%” is pronounced as “then”, when you “read” your code\n\n\n\nHow should we style our code?\n\nUse the tidyverse style guide as introduced in the course: https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html\nMake sure that all scripts are styled the same way and be consistent in your coding style\nYour code should not be >80 chars wide, follow the vertical line in your editor\n\n\n\nHow should we style our plots?\n\nBe concise, “less is more”\nMake some nice and relevant plots. Show us that you’ve learned data visualisation. Remember legends, titles etc.\nDo not put 3 messages in 1 plot. Instead put each message into a different plot\nBe careful with matching the text size in your plots to that of your presentation (trial-and-error)"

However, be aware that GitHub is meant for code, not data.\n\n\n\nWhat goes in the “doc” folder?\n\nThe project organisation chart is a generic figure. You should not hand in a report.

Therefore, the “doc” folder would in this case contain your presentation\n\n\n\nWhy are there multiple “reports” in the “doc” folder?\n\nIn case you have a computationally intensive part of the project it can be an advantage to split into sub-reports and then collect in a master report (think large LaTeX reports)\nOverview, even if your report is not computationally intensive, then it may be long and splitting into sub-reports facilitate better overview\n\n\n\nShould we include a README on GitHub?\n\nThat would be a good way to briefly introduce what the contents of this repo is and something one would usually do\n\n\n\nShould everything be on Github, also plots we don’t present?\n\nYes, everything!"

If you only have two numerical values, then perhaps a table is fine. If you have 100 observations, then a plot is likely better\nRemember, we are as humans evolutionary encoded to interpret visual information, not numbers\n\n\n\nHow do we add plots to the rmarkdown presentation?\n\nOutput the plot as a png file using the function ggsave and include that png in your presentation. Think dynamically, we don’t want to type anything manually in our presentation\n\n\n\nHow do we get the presentation in wide-/full screen?\n\nHit w and f while the HTML presentation is loaded\n\n\n\nShould we split our presentation into sub-presentations?\n\nNo, this is not necessary given the extend/size of this project. Just create one Rmd file, which outputs an HTML-presentation\n\n\n\nWe are working on re-creating paper results. Should we re-create the exact same plots?\n\nIdeally, you re-create the plots and then you create your own improved version of the visualisation.\n\n\n\nWhere should we “place” our Shiny app in our presentation?\n\nDemo it briefly at the end\n\n\n\nHow can we illustrate our data handling?\n\nConsider creating a flow chart, what are input files and how are they connected to final output?\n\n\n\nHow much code should we include in the presentation?\n\nThe exam deliverables are two-fold. Code is the GitHub repo and your ability to communicate biological insights is in the presentation. Therefore, code could be included in the presentation if you faced and solved a particularly challenging problem\n\n\n\nHow do we include data numbers in the presentation?\n\nYou could from your script output a results table with relevant numbers as a .tsv file and then read that into the presentation and extract the numbers\nRemember, think dynamical reporting, what if your input data changes and you manually entered the numbers in your presentation? Then you wouldn’t be much farther than a powerpoint\n\n\n\nWhat goes into the materials and methods section?\n\nMaterials: What data did you use and where did you get it from?\nMethods: Which modelling did you use? Think of the methods section as a recipe for how to go from raw to results => Flow chart?\n\n\n\nShould we interpret our results?\n\nYes, you have to think about it as a “normal” project presentation\n\n\n\nWhat about all the stuff we tried, which did not work?\n\nIn the presentation, you should focus on what worked and what results you arrived at\nExclude dead-ends from the presentation, but… Leave them in the repo, perhaps with an initial comment signifying that the following turned out to be a dead-end\nThink about this - Scenario: You’re working in a company and you and your team of 3 spend 6 months on a project, which turns out to be a dead-end. For future reference: Would the company be interested in knowing that this project was a dead end or should you delete everything and never speak of it again?"
