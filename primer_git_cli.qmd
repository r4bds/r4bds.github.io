# `git` command line vs. RStudio GUI {.unnumbered}

If you are handy with the terminal, it is a good idea to learn `git`'s command-line interface. When using git from the 
terminal, you can pair it with any code editor or programming language without worrying about where the git buttons are 
or if they behave slightly differently between different code editors. The error messages are also much easier to understand 
and you get the general advantages of the terminal: it is faster and automatable.

Of course, both the GUI and the Terminal are powerful, and it's completely normal to use a combination of both. And even if you
prefer only the GUI, it is still useful to know the terminal version for when you use a code editor different than RStudio.

This primer will explain the basics of the `git` command-line interface by comparing it to the RStudio Git tab.

## GitHub credentials

When pushing to a GitHub repository, or when pulling from a private one, GitHub needs to authenticate that you are the actual owner of
your account. [In Lab 7 we used Personal Access Tokens](lab07.qmd#setting-up-your-credentials-and-personal-access-token), but when working 
purely from the Linux terminal, it is most common to use SSH keys.

First, create an ssh key by running `ssh-keygen` (leave everything empty by pressing enter a few times) and then `cd` into `~./.ssh`.

You will see 1 or more pairs of files named `whatever` and `whatever.pub`. Copy the contents the one ending in `.pub` (if there are multiple, 
any of them will work). Then add it to your GitHub account by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account).

## Setting `git` options

The equivalent of the `usethis::use_git_config(<option_name> = <value>)` function that [we used in Lab 7](lab07.qmd#setting-up-gits-pull-strategy) is:

```bash
git config --global <option_name> <value>
```

The `--global` flag will make the option persist across all your `git` repositories, but you can remove it to apply the configuration
to only the current repo. You can undo it with:

```bash
git config unset --global <option_name>
```

## Creating a repository and connecting it to GitHub

These instructions are valid regardless of whether you want to create a completely empty repository or whether you want 
to convert an existing RStudio project (or any folder with code) into a git repository. To create an empty one, simply
create the folder or RStudio project and go from there.

#### Terminal

`cd` into the directory with code you want to turn into a git repository and run `git init`. From then you
can use all of `git`'s functionality.

On whatever git repository hosting service you use (e.g. GitHub), you will find instructions on how to pair a newly 
created repo with your local `git` repo. On GitHub, simply follow the instructions under *…or push an existing repository 
from the command line* that will appear in your newly created repo (you must have created at least 1 commit).

#### RStudio

1. Click on your `.Rproj` file under the `Files` tab.
1. Click on `Git/SVN`
1. On `Version control system:`, select git
1. When asked if you want to initialize a git repository, click on `Yes` (if it asks you to restart RStudio, say yes again)

At this point, you can create commits and branches as you like, or go back to any previous commit. However the local repo is 
not connected to GitHub yet, so you will not be able to pull or push.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no way to do this from the RStudio GUI, but can you always just follow the Terminal 
instructions above (skipping the `git init`, which is what you just did) or in the case of creating a new project, simply 
create it [as we did in Lab 7](lab07.qmd#creating-the-repository).


## Checking the repository status

The `git status` command will show you a summary of any changed and/or new files that are not committed. In RStudio, the equivalent
is simply looking at the *Status* column of the Git tab.

## Pulling and pushing

The equivalent of the ![](images/pull.png) Pull button is `git pull`, while the ![](images/push.png) Push button is `git push`.

## Creating commits

#### Adding to the staging area

To add a file to the staging area, you do:

```bash
git add <file_path> # you can add as many paths as you want
```

This is the equivalent of ticking the check boxes of the *Staged* column in the Git tab of Rstudio.

#### Reviewing and commiting the contents of the staging area

When you click the *Diff* or *Commit* button in the RStudio Git tab, you will get a nice visualization with deleted (or modified)
lines of code in red, and new lines in green. On the top right of that, you can then add a commit message and click *Commit*.

In the terminal you can get the nice visualization with:

```bash
git diff --staged
``` 

And once you have reviewed it, you can commit by running:

```bash
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

## Branching

To create a new branch in RStudio, you click the new branch button (![](images/git_new_branch.png)) in the Git tab and switch between 
branches with the little dropdown to the right of the new branch button. 

In the terminal, you create the branch with:

```bash
git branch <your_branch_name>
```

You can verify that it was created by listing existing branches with `git branch` (simply running it without a branch name). Note that 
it will only list branches in your local repo, which will not necessarily contain all branches from GitHub. Add the `--all` option to 
also show branches in the remote repository (i.e., the GitHub repo).

You can switch to the newly created branch (or any other branch) with: 

```bash
git checkout <your_branch_name>
```

Alternatively, you can create the branch and switch to it at once by adding the `-b` option to `checkout`: 

```bash
git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
```

## Time travelling

#### Looking into the past

The window that pops up when clicking the *History* button on the Git tab has a lot of information, which can be obtained from the
terminal with a few different commands.

The `git log` command will show you a list of all the existing commits. The long "random" code on each commit is code is called 
the *commit hash* and is a unique identifier for each commit.

You can view the exact changes that were made in that commit by doing:

```bash
git show <commit_hash>
``` 

Or see all the (cumulative) changes between 2 commits with:

```bash
git diff <commit_hash_1> <commit_hash_2>
```

#### When this baby hits 88 miles per hour...

As far as we know, there is no way of reverting back to a previous commit from the RStudio GUI. From the terminal, the same `checkout` 
command that we use to change branches can also be used:

```bash
git checkout <commit_hash>
```

Once you are done investigating why you have a bug that didn't exist before your colleague started messing with the code, you can
`git log` again to find the most recent commit and `checkout` back to the future.
