## Design

The exam consists of 3 components:

1. A group project, where all members are responsible for all parts of the project. This is handed in as a code base on the course GitHub repository
1. An oral group presentation of the project, where all group members, as per DTU rules on oral exams, must be physically present
1. A two hour multiple choice quiz (MCQ) exam, where general course learning objectives are examined

*See course description at DTU course base for further description*

## Deadlines and Dates

1. The oral group presentation will be on lab 13 of the course, see DTU Learn calender for dates

## Content

### The Group Project

- Be sure that **everyone** understands **ALL** code in the project as **all group members are responsible for ALL code**
- The aim of the project is to cover the entire course cycle, so be sure to align your project
- Be sure to read [Project Description](#sec-projdesc)
- Questions? Make sure to consult the [Project FAQ](#sec-projfaq)

### The Presentation

- The format is 10-slides-in-10-mins
- Everyone in the group must present a part of the project
- Expect a few overall questions regarding the decisions you have made throughout your project
- IMPORTANT: The final presentation in HTML-format must be zipped and uploaded to DTU Learn before deadline, so we can check the GitHub version is identical

### The MCQ

- A 2-hour individual multiple choice exam
- In 2022 the exam contained 60 questions, expect a similar number of questions
- All aids are allowed, but no open internet
- Each question will have 4 possible answers and only 1 is the right one and you can only choose one answer per question
